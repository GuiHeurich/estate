it makes you an archive of links.
the links can go out to other
websites or point inward.  mirrored
html pages are put between a common
header and footer and link back to
the archive index.  that's about
all it does, and that is why it is
so little.

i do not expect anyone to use this
but the maintainer of _why's estate.
and if i ever hand over that
position, i totally expect the new
maintainer to switch over to
something else, as they would have
to be crazy to try and pick through
this codemess.

_why's estate can be reached at:
