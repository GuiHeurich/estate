This is not a documentary. It is not intended to reach out to you. It is a story
about a good conversationalist. There will be no explanation as to why he is a
good conversationalist in the end.



                                  THE GOOD CON



They don't want my beauty at the book store. I lied about everything. "Why do
you want to work in a bookstore?" Per say. The image came out at best, beauty
and the books stuffed in her nylons and her trachea. Not a breath passing
through without paper. John Gray. "Pretend that I came up to you and I want to
know where to find John Gray," she said and I said next to Grisholm. Well that
really swung her neck into a pecking techtonic gesture and her fingers, like
little shears, like manhandling for shears, snippity like that she says the John
Gray wrote Men are from Mars, "Women are from Venus," I help. "Oh, the doctor,"
I say. It didn't come out as doctor, though, more Dr. I didn't want the job
after that. I went over to my moms house and moved some things from the office
into my old room. We took the bed apart, I got sleepy so I went into my younger
sisters bedroom to sleep. It got me thinking how generous I had been. I had been
generous to the bookstore, and had gotten high hopes about finding a job. I
realized that a lot of people get away with interviewing and working at book
stores. One specific example is the lady that interviewed /me/ not even twenty
minutes earlier. She was unfit and disorganized. A hazard in the body of a
gentlecreature. A baby killer AND a protagonist. I fell asleep and had a dream
that my old furniture was back in the old room.
