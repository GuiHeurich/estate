            PICKING UP THE DADDYBIRD


       
                       (a story)




I AM BROAD.


You might say, "A fellow with a sun tan."
That's fair and the girl is staring at the cassette
tape she snapped in half. Now in the ashtray.

I'm ready to get back to bowling. I really am.

    I WENT up the elevator. I am vice
principal. "Let's not throw," I tell them both.
  They seethe at each other. How tacky.
  The younger kid (who got thrown) with the
Cowboys jacket is a dufus and goes into the
computer room to pout. I know. I ought to
put some of that surplus book money into
stocks. The GAP, like Greg did. I'm not mad
at this kid in the Oilers jacket. He flew in
here. Because he was really fighting for
sports. He's puffy and astro.

  "You flew in here," I tell him after we started
going up to 3. "You're mean."
  He beat on his knee with his thumb. I think,
'What is he?' I'll bet he's real soft for his mom.
SHE SCREAMS. He's out there trying to
knock the ice off the trashcan for her. He'll
think, 'Not like other Oilers fans.' Banging ice
off for his mom. I want to get an oversized
satelite dish. Or a fun, little camcorder and a
satelite dish.

  Oh, I got to get to a window. I want to see if that
pancake house has a hole in the top. The principal
has pictures of kids getting down into it. Debate
team kids. None of them have lettered. I've kept
watch. So I mean there's no letter jacket kids in the
pictures, throwing their arm out to get in the hole.
The principal loves it when the kids find things like
that. He crawls all over looking for holes. He has
such a dumpy van. He's greasy. And the twins are
five and they won't stop acting like dogs.

They've been acting like dogs for five years. He
absolutely loves it. He spreads relish and looks
over like he's got two real dogs around. "I love
those _dog's_ lips," he says and he's greasy, right?
So it's just nasty. And they play with his greasy
burger napkins in the back of the van. It sucks.
So I'm going to look for that hole in case
someone wants to take pictures of me going
down.

  While going up, the kid opened the emergency phone
box and held it open with his knee. I wanted to spank
him. Or actually, I wanted to laugh. Like, "Hey, I'm not
too serious." He grabbed the phone. He yanked it. The
cord snapped. It slid on the floor. To me. That's when I
wanted to spank him. I reached down and picked up the
receiver like I was going to call the twins. They even
have two little doghouses with pillows shaped like bones.
And why do they turn everything upside down? Because
they think they're dogs in the first place.

  The cord dangled like a busted brain nerve to my own
brain. I could never be content with this phone again.
That laine in ALF. That "I kill me" line. I swear I thought
the kid was going to say that now. But not like ALF.
Like serious. I kill me.

  So the elevator opened. Commotion. The art fair's
this year. So that's on the walls. The art students suck
this year. They all paint chairs and old piles of rags.

Be nice if we got them a shed. A shed for their chairs
and rags both. Because it's all on school property
right now. These kids... they paint on freezing, cold
metal. We could (say) get them a shed until this stage
blows over. Until they make up their minds to paint
something beautiful. I think it would be wise to paint a
real hard-bitten western guy, straight out of the west.
Just standing. Not rebelling. Not rocking out. Looking
straight at you. And some of these out-of-luck kids I
see could watch him being so silent while their dad
rushes to work and always skips breakfast. And some of
those kids would pump their chins, studying him while
their moving with the Air Force and the western guy
(dude) is the last thing they move because he's the only
guy who pays attention anyway. Your mom could say,
"Hey, pay attention like he does." Or your aunt. Santa
could give it to you for Christmas. And then we could give
the art kids their walls back again. We'd fill the shed with
dynamite and blow it sky high. It'd register on the county
radar system. There'd be coverage.

Man, I wish someone would have painted my father back in the
day. I remember some good art kids in those days. I should
have got the kid who did the painting of Sinatra to do it. I really
should of. He's probably been swallowed by a hog now.
There's probably no way now. But Bill looked a lot like
Sinatra. He had a curl in front. He always sang real quiet. Like
you'd go to bed, then you'd turn off the lights just so you could
hear better. He had a rag, too. But he used it to shine. And
he'd whip his shoes with the rag. But real soft singing, like it was
just your mattress breathing, and not your dad. Man, they could
do another painting and the western guy's looking down with his
hat in his hands. With his hat full of water.

THE GIRL IS staring across the alley at the arcade.

  Real nice twisted neck you got there, girl. She's
probably thinking, 'What am I going to do if he strikes
again?' It would be four. Four very naughty ones.
Good question, 'What am I going to do if he strikes
again?'

  I was complaining because she doesn't get excited
enough. You missed it. I told her I'd get her a Jeep if
she'd just squeal high. I'm big around here. Against
the wall: that whole crowd. I taught three-quarters of
them when I taught P.E. None of them are laughing
or pleased at all. They're using powder on their
hands. I've got a good orange ball. I only recognize
one of them: I think that Jacob kid walked in on me
that time I was horsing around in the gym.

I'll bet he waited till I was spinning around on the rings
to walk in. Dirty skunk. I get so worried he took a
picture. I wonder where he put the picture.
  That skunk. I'll bet it's in one circle with family
pictures in the other circles and squares. Filthy rabbit.
Because I put on a penny and way grabbed the rings
and started kicking my legs up. Doing swivel moves.
That's honestly the only way you can do flips if you're
not taught when you're a baby.

               I TELL YOU:

  I tell you: If I had learned flips as a boy, as vice
principal I would find some kids in trouble. I would go
to the other end of the hall and flips the whole way
down and do a final quasiflip with a spin and land
doing the splits. And say, "Until you can do that,
there will be no fights." Then only the kids real
serious about fighting would learn it.
  And I'd put drops in my eyes.
  To the girl I say, "You look nice. Do I look nice?"

  I jog over and get my ball and curl it up into my arm. I found a
good ball that looks like a scoop of orange sherbet. Let's roll.
  So she hooks her arms into the cavities of her purse and
launches a wild spray of change at me. (I'm up at the dots,
about to strike.) She's not getting me. Op, well, there she hit my
shoe. I think I'll chase her. I'll bet it was $2.50 for shoes. Oh!
She left her shoes! Oh, she's got her shoes. She's off.

  Oh, I get it. She runs away, while I
have to change my shoes. How about
I change them real slow and collected?
Nothing happened. Just a girl. Didn't
really know her. Did something serious
happen to her? Ooo, wow, that's hairy.
I didn't even know dragons were real.
That's cool. But, yeah.
  I start to turn my shoes in, but she
really gets out fast and so I stick
around. I get a toothpick from the
dispenser. I have a seat. I should call
the twins.

  I should call the twins and babysit. Just for
an hour. Get them some wizard outfits. Make
them think they are wizards. "Look at those
wizards' lips," I'd say and I'm not all greasy,
right?
  Principal would be mad at me. Especially
when I put them to bed.
  "What? Teaching my babies that wizards
live in doghouses?" he'd say. "You--a ranking
officer of education!?"
  Yep, me.
