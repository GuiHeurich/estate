<P>Pretty much, I hate celebrities. That's not too bold to say, because I
mean there's a lot of people I hate. I mean I hate people who live on
either coast. I mean that just has to be the stupidest place to live.
"Hey, I live on the coast." Oh, that's really something. Great. Alright.
Well, let's just get on with this part of the magazine.
<P>I send e-mail to all kinds of celebrities when I find their supposed
e-mail addresses. Then, on occassion, they'll send me back replies. Most
of the time the response is bland and contains no nouns. So I don't print
the bulk of what I receive. I hate that. But I've been getting some e-mail
from celebrities that is of exceedingly fine craftsmanship. I wish I could
talk Spanish.
</P><P>Now, I don't know if these letters are coming from the actual celebrities.
There's no possible way I can verify that without having to meet them and
I would hate that. So, please keep in mind that these letters may be
coming from a living, thinking, typing spiral staircase. If this is the
situation, then please answer this question Mister Spiral Staircase, if
you do indeed live: Could I climb on top of you and ride you into the
ocean, where we could meet mighty Poseidon and become slaves to the water?
</P><P>My favorite e-mail response is this one, which I received from one of the
Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers. I found their addresses when I was
preparing to write this column and so I sent them all messages that looked
much like this:

Subject: The future
I know you guys are putting out this big blockbuster movie and things 
are going pretty good for you, but is this what you're planning on 
doing for a while?  I mean is this what you call being the 
'breadwinner' of the family?  I think you are pathetic and I hope 
this e-mail changes your mind about a lot of things.  You have a big, 
big problem and apparently you're doing nothing to solve it.

Hey, come check out Soccer Riot Magazine at http://members.tripod.com/soccer_riot</PRE>
<P>Now that I look back on that letter, I kind of feel bad about it. I was
pretty rude to the blue ranger and that last line was pretty cocky to
stick in there. But, I pretty much hate the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers.
And when I got the response, I just kind of thought, "These guys are just
stupid."

<P>I was kind of hoping that I wouldn't get a ton of responses like that. I
mean you can tell it's just a form letter that some guy who is obviously
not the blue ranger filled out. I guess I didn't get very many like that
letter. For instance, I'm not a big Tom Clancy fan, but I found his e-mail
address (which is easy to find) and I sent him a letter to congratulate
him on success.

<P>I could understand if he said that to somebody like Howie Mandel, who is
screwed and really doesn'ty understand the phrase "human predicament."
But, all I said was, "Hey, Clancy, my dad likes your book." And he says,
"You don't understand--" Anyway, I'm kind of mad about that letter and so
I've sent him a bunch of flames. I don't know. Maybe I don't understand
the human predicament.
<P>Well, I'm going to move to one of my favorite exchanges of e-mail. I found
at www.nbc.com a list of various e-mail addresses and home pages of their
actors. For instance, I found the e-mail address of Wayne Knight, who
played Newman on NBC's <I>Seinfeld</I>, which is a very good program mostly.
Here's the letter I sent him:

Wayne, what kind of music do you listen to?

<P>
To tell the truth, this message was sent because I was honestly curious. I
love all kinds of music and I collect a lot of different kinds of music. I
love records and oldies. I love compact discs and alternative. So, I did
not write this message for this column. This message was something I was
really wondering.

Subject: Music I Like
I really enjoy Mary Chapin Carpenter.  My favorite song on that album 
is "Passionate Kisses."  Also, I like James Taylor.  Have you heard 
"Frozen Man"?  I think that's his best song.  So, I guess you hate me 
now.  I suppose it's not right anyway.

</PRE>
<P>This just made me feel awful. I mean here's a celebrity I actually like.
Not only that, but I love James Taylor. I have almost all of his albums. I
admit that I don't like Mary Chapin Carpenter. I'm not sure what
"Passionate Kisses" is, so I'm not going to say whether or not I like it.
Maybe she has a song that I might like. But, then he says that I probably
hate him. Now what kind of e-mail is this? See, the thing I've got to
remember is that I don't know who is writing the e-mail. I don't know if
it's Wayne Knight.
</P><P>
I'm pretty sure this next one came from the person it claims to come from.
I found the e-mail address to Unsolved Mysteries, so I sent a message to
Robert Stack, because I hate him. I think he's an idiot. So I just made up
a stupid story.
<PRE>
To: unsolved@nbc.com
From: whytheluckystiff@mailcity.com
Subject: Robert Stack
THIS MESSAGE MUST GET TO ROBERT STACK.  I KNOW THIS E-MAIL ADDRESS IS 
A SERVER, SO PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT I AM A UNITED STATES CITIZEN AND 
HAVE AS MUCH RIGHT TO SPEAK TO MR. STACK AS ANY NBC EXECUTIVE.  
PLEASE FORWARD THIS TO ROBERT STACK.  PLEASE.
Mr. Stack,
  I know your show is always looking for people who have their own, 
personal unsolved mysteries to solve.  I am no exception.  I was 
visited by an alien craft in June.  On the twenty-forth of June.  The 
alien ship looked like a giant peanut butter cookie. Previous to the 
visitation, I hated that sort of cookie, but now I love peanut butter 
cookies.  Can you connect me with others who have been visited by 
these sorts of space friends?

<P>
I tried this tactic alot. I add a little header there that talks all about
how THIS MESSAGE IS REALLY IMPORTANT PLEASE PROCESS and like that. So,
naturally, I got a message back from the server about a week and a half
later.

I manage this server and have not had the opportunity to let Robert 
Stack read what his fans would like to say to him.  I have put your 
request in his box at an attempt to let him know about your

Now that's a decent server message. Most servers say, "Robert has read
your message and complimented you with kudos from everyone at Unsolved
Mysteries. He will be adding your e-mail to a personal collection of his
favorite messages from the information superhighway." But, this server
seemed honest and I was a little surprised to hear from Robert Stack the
very next day.

>thanks for yuor story.  have you been to the planet crystalus

</PRE>
<P>The bulk of the letter is pretty casual and unusual, but its the last
sentence that made me laugh. "Have you been to the planet Crystalus?" I
wonder where that is? That guy is really dumb. What a wierd message. But,
I respect him for answering my e-mail and I hope to have better responses
for next week. I don't understand the human predicament. </P><P>
