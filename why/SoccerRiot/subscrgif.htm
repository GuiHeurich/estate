       you probably live in a cartoon.  you probably live in a box of matches in that same cartoon.  you don't have any calendars, because nobody ever draws calendars.  you have a flying cheese grater, with room enough for seven more of you.  you sleep on the long arm of the clock and at midnight you get a headrush.  you have a special stapler to keep your waffles together.  the grasshoppers can have beards and the snapdragons can have pipes.  you are pretty frugal.  your wallet is full of cartoon bucks.  still, you are glad you aren't a real person.  </td>
