I'm teaching a Ruby workshop to high school students and it might be  
nice to have a printed copy of the Poignant Guide. I'm thinking of  
doing a layout and using a service like http://lulu.com to print it.  
I think I could do it for $15-20 per copy.

Is the gentleman who put together the Poignant PDF still on this  
list? Did you use PageMaker/Indesign/Quark to do the layout, or  
something else? Could I get a copy of the original files so I can  
reformat them for book printing? Otherwise I'll just start from scratch.


Thanks,

Subject: Chapter 6 Error

I noticed that a code example in chapter-6.html seems to flag an error in
1.8.4.

m = "bats!"
 eval %{
   def #{ m }
     puts "{" * 100
   end
}

bats.rb:2: unterminated string meets end of file

The "{" has to be "\{" or Ruby 1.8.4 flags the %{} block as an unterminated
string.

I find this book very entertaining and quite useful.
   
  My only critique is the use of 'Goofy' code. When learning a new language, it's best if the material contains useful working code to experiment with. This way you know what your learning actually works and can be used to create your own code.
   
  It would be nice to have the code for endertromb and have the wordlist require work.
  I simple took the code_words Hash and stuck it at the top of the program that uses it.
   
  Having fun with Ruby.
   
  Thanks
