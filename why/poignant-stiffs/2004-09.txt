Thanks for this response, Bruce.  I thought I had responded at the time. 
Mentally I guess.  This one's for the record.

I hope to increase the number of examples that are as you've described. 
  Still, the nature of this book demands some esoteric examples that 
border more on becoming riddles than actual code.

It's more important to me that this book be a novel than a manual.  My 
priority is to peak people's interest in the language by telling a fine 
story and creating something wholy new.  So I look at the code examples 
in the same way I look at dialogue or motifs.

You're absolutely right.  I don't feel like I come off as egotistical or 
anything -- so I probably wouldn't agree with that slant off the word 
"pretentious."  But I do talk inanely and galavant anywhere I please.

The distractions and the chaos in the text gets worse.  When instruction 
happens, I try to be focused and natural and succinct.  But the 
surrounding themes fall all over each other.  I'm trying to write the 
kind of book I've always wanted to read.

At this point, I'm more concerned about finishing the book than 
tailoring my style.  I'll figure out how to write over time.  If there's 
any specific parts of the book that drive you nuts, I'd really enjoy 
pulling them apart.

Hi, a bit of news on the (Poignant) Guide.

Okay, okay, okay, I've taken forever.  But I said I'd take forever, so 
we're fine, right?

Chapter Five is so close, a page maybe.  I don't know why the drawings 
took so long but they did.  And this chapter is massive, the largest in 
the book.  But it's on its way, I swear on a pile of Sailor Moon action 
figures that it's just about here.

As proof, I'm including a few choice moments from the next chapter to 
give you hope and show you my appreciation for your long wait.  Many 
thanks for all the letters which are just like mini-elk horns, somewhat 
embarassing to put on display around my staircase, but great for 
prodding me from behind.

I'm just emphasizing that you always keep site of the goal, whatever it 
is.

I'm not particularly interested in being entertained when reading about 
programming; I want to be illuminated.  I want to understand how to do 
it, which is different than just being shown what to do.  So, if your 
writing helps me understand the principles of programming in a language 
like Ruby -- that must by definition go beyond "what to do" bluntness 
-- then great.

Beloved friends and key witnesses: Holy highkick! I (at last) present

Fifty-two pages of spooky new adventures in Ruby.  This is a big one
for me: the book is now halfway.  And I guarantee to you that -- should
you read -- you will be in a new place, wading in the schemings of pygmy

What is the (Poignant) Guide?  I am here to tell you that it is a very
obscure book, a minor ripple in the orchestrations of mankind, a 
scattered amalgamation of inky blotches and ridiculous code fragments -- 
at best -- a transcription of animal software from the original 
woodblock prints.  And I haven't meant to corrupt the text with my 
snivelling biographies, but it has happened already, what can be
done?

A printable HTML version is available as well.  You'll find a link to it 
and instructions for printing in Firefox at the Guide's site.  Be aware, 
it's large as a squirrel heaven.  Let it load, let it.

Well, cheerio.  Thankyou to Matz for his excellent resource "Ruby in a 
Nutshell".  It's the employee handbook here at the plant.

Was just looking through the new chapter.  As a general rule, shouldn't 
all code you offer as example be valid, only relying on standard 
libraries and such?  E.g.:

require 'endertromb'
LoadError: No such file to load -- endertromb
         from (irb):51:in `require'
         from (irb):51

As a beginner, at that point I throw up my hands and stop reading.

I can tell this is really frustrating you.  Would it be helpful if I put 
the more esoteric examples in a different color so they're obvious?  I 
need some room in here to write some bogus code.  Can I get you to let 
me get away with it?  This isn't a capital crime or anything.  At some 
points, I'm just using the code as a plot device rather than a actual 
script.

However, I can't speak to this technique's effectiveness.  I'm goofing 
around with a buncha stuff in this book and I can only guess if any of 
it really works.  If it drives a good amount of you nuts, I'll find 
something better.  Is anyone else troubled by this?  How much room do I 
have to goof off with the code?

Thanks, Bruce.  I really want to hear about the painful parts, it'll 
help me shape things significantly.

No, but it is helpful to be able to follow along with irb, just to see 
how the code works.  So, "goofy" examples may be fine; I just want them 
to work.

This has been my general experience learning anything related to code, 
whether with TeX, XSLT, etc.: I simply learn better if I have working 
code examples, even they aren't necessarily practical (though to be 
honest, it's easier if they are practical in a lot of cases).

In that example, is there any reason you couldn't illustrate the same 
idea without the bogus "require"?

Yeah, you want practical examples.  Does every example have to be 
practical?  Can some be hypothetical?

Well, even without the 'require', the code doesn't function.  The 
Endertromb constant is imaginary.

Cool, thanks for giving the guide a try.  I really appreciate it.  I've 
been working on a PDF, though I don't have anything that looks 
reasonably nice yet.  But, hopefully, in the next few months it'll come 
together.  I'm also rescanning and touching up the art to ensure the 
print quality is superb.

Hi why...question:

Are you trying to compete with the many practical, boring, but
interactive (Try It online) examples from the "Programming Ruby: The
Pragmatic Programmer's Guide" at:

http://www.ruby.ch/ProgrammingRuby/htmlC/

??

Maybe you can make all the examples abstract? Or maybe impractical, at
least? Refreshing change from the usual engineering-inspired mindset :)
Just kidding. Some illustrative examples are fine. See Spot. See Spot
run. I haven't seen a dog named Spot yet, but I got the point :)

Keep up the good work.

I suppose, so long as it's clear for the "dummies" when you're 
presenting hypotheticals and when you're presenting working examples.

I could imagine doing that either in the text, or perhaps as you 
suggest, graphically.

BTW, re: the PDF, I agree that'd be valuable.  If you author this using 
redcloth, perhaps there's an easy way to spit out LaTeX code that can 
then be typeset with pdftex?

Hi,

Many months ago, before my bosses started beating on me with sticks 
(note to bosses: I'm not complaining about the sticks...) I was looking 
at modifying redcloth to produce tex output. I got as far as producing 
headings and basic text. I stopped being productive around sidebars and 
pictures. The basics were there, but there was a lot of work left to be 
done. I think that using LaTeX is the "right" way to make a pdf. Maybe 
other simpler markup languages to make PDFs exist, but if I remember 
correctly the biggest roadblock was that redcloth is HTML-centric.

If redcloth output clean semantic xhtml (with class attributes on 
everything not explicitly support in html, like footnotes), I could 
probably (if I find the time) write the xslt to get the latex code.

I've got RedCloth outputting PDFs.  Getting the sidebars to flow right 
is the tricky part.  Everything else is sort of not hard.

Agreed.

My take: yes to the imaginary code. And much of it. I more or less 
*read* the Poignant Guide, and after that, apply some of it in irb. 
So, to me, all the examples could be hypothetical. The ones that work 
in real life could be mascoted, cheesed, or Remington Steeled.

Stiffness,

God, that is the FINEST description of scope. Steely exteriors. Ah, I 
read this like candy, one page a day. No more. Work first, then play,

Very cool stuff--thanks tons for this.

FWIW--I don't know if it's b/c there was an unnaturally long period of time
between reading ch1-4 and ch5, but I was a tad bewildered in a couple of
spots:

The :: syntax in the first snippet in section 2 (Endertromb::make( wish ))
is not familiar--you're calling a wish method on the Endertromb class,
right?  Not sure why it's not just Endertromb.make().  Later on you show the
same syntax as a method for interrogating classes for their members--maybe
:: is a reflection thing?  Please ignore if you've actually explained this &
I was just inattentive.

In the section headed "The mechanisms of name-calling", where you add some
stuff to the string class you refer to @@syllables as an array--but isn't
that a hash?  Wait--now I see--it's an array of two hashes.  I didn't catch
that the first time around.  I took it on faith that the shift method
translated an index into a value, but would have loved a discussion of
shift.  Also, reading off paper away from my computer, I *really* could have
used a "puts catsandtips" w/results shown after the code snippet
demonstrating Array.collect.  After playing w/it & rereading the description
it makes perfect sense, but at the time it was kind of a whaaa? moment.

Again, thanks for this wonderful book--I'm eagerly anticipating the next
chapter!

Peace,

-Roy

Beloved friends and key witnesses: Holy highkick! I (at last) present 
chapter five!

Fifty-two pages of spooky new adventures in Ruby.  This is a big one for me:
the book is now halfway.  And I guarantee to you that -- should you read --
you will be in a new place, wading in the schemings of pygmy elephants and
deer with powdered wigs.

Travel now and read: http://poignantguide.net/ruby/

What is the (Poignant) Guide?  I am here to tell you that it is a very
obscure book, a minor ripple in the orchestrations of mankind, a 
scattered amalgamation of inky blotches and ridiculous code fragments -- 
at best -- a transcription of animal software from the original 
woodblock prints.  And I haven't meant to corrupt the text with my 
snivelling biographies, but it has happened already, what can be done?

A printable HTML version is available as well.  You'll find a link to it 
and instructions for printing in Firefox at the Guide's site.  Be aware, 
it's large as a squirrel heaven.  Let it load, let it.

Well, cheerio.  Thankyou to Matz for his excellent resource "Ruby in a 
Nutshell".  It's the employee handbook here at the plant.

I consider it very bad style to do

  Class::method

when

  Class.method

works and is consistent with

  object.method

(since a class is an object, so doesn't need special syntax).

:: should be reserved for accessing constants.

Just reinforcing your point.

Cheers,
Gavin

Well, this is arbitrary to me.  I like using the double-colon syntax 
because it's unambiguous.  What is IO.read?  Are you refering to 
IO::read or IO#read?  Could make it easier to naturally use Ri.  I'd 
rather teach the syntax which errs on the side of clarity.  But maybe 
it's easier for people to just learn the period and see `::` and `#` as 
notations for the docs.

I think I just need to rework these two examples which open Dr. Cham's 
exploration of the castle.  They seem to be confusing to enough people 
that it's probably best to try something new.

I'm referring to IO.read, of course!  That is, sending the message
'read' to the object IO.  Of the two choices above, that corresponds
to IO::read.  IO#read actually evaluates to IO. :)

The second one most definitely _is_ notation for the docs.  We get
questions every now and then about it.

You're right that 'ri' is ambiguous, and that '.' can mean '::' or '#'
(an arbitrary construct) depending on context.  Users should be made
aware of that.
