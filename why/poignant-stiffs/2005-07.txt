Team, I'm looking for feedback on the new look of the book:

Still working on it, somethingsies may be broke.  The red is vanquished. 
  Is okay?  CSS bugs?

On the first page the text about the lost foxes seems to overlap. It
looks like this happens with certain font-sizes.

The w3.org css-validator says there's an error in the stylesheet.

The line spacing of the "NEW! Lost foxes ..." causes

Title page:

 The description/line to the *1st edition* Pickaxe is dated?

General:

 Toning down the background a bit would be kinder on my eyes.

 Characters per line ~90 > recommended ~60 for single-spaced text,
  but leading is fairly large, so it remains readable.

 Chapter 6 is so long, it scares me.  (I haven't read it yet. amd
  mostly for that heretofore mentinoed reason.)

Please, continue to "Them What Live the Dream"!  Oh, and thanks
for still sharing.

It's too bright?  This is on the the front page?  Or do you mean the 
diagonal lines?

I was wondering why you haven't read this yet.  Did you read chapter 
five, cause it's even longer?  Maybe I could break these chapters up 
into sections for reading on the web.

And maybe my editor needs to show up to work.  I've never even met him.  
I think he is all tied up trying to stuff his sleeves back into his suit 
cuffs.

The black on white text hurts me.  Everywhere.  I have to look
away occasionally to recover or turn the contrast way down on
the monitor.

Yes caught me: I haven't read chapter 5 either.  It was
like a stone wall right after chapter 4.  Besides, my sides
hurt too much from laughing, so I thought I'd give them
a break before I separated a rib.

What about breaking up these chapters '.'?

Thanks again for all the words,

With any luck, tomorrow will be the release of the first six songs of 
the soundtrack to the (Poignant) Guide, pulled off by The Thirsty Cups, 
a few of whom will be coming to OSCON to perform some of these songs.  
If you'd like a preview of some preliminary and poorly mixed versions of 
the songs, try here: <http://poignantguide.net/sdtrk/>

Whilst listening, you might wonder the following:
* How will these be entwined with the online manual (vis-a-vis scrolling 
and listening)?
(This I'm not sure.  A miniature flash ghettoblaster?)
* Will these come with the book when it is printed?
(Yes, tucked in a flap, this is a fact by now.)

Hmm.  I don't know -- so far you've managed to strike a solid balance
between Art-with-a-capital-A and usability/readability.

However, I'm not sure people would deal well with music playing while
they read online.  Most browsers' attention is divided.  This is _not_
ultra-background music, and music-playing webpages tend to be obnoxious
to begin with...

What I would probably recommend is adding links to stream and download
the chapter's song (i.e. a one-song .m3u pointing to the .mp3 and a
direct link to the .mp3, respectively) to the top and bottom of each
chapter, and leaving it at that.

This lets them use their music player of choice, and isn't overly
intrusive.

I expect most people reading casually on the web will want to read the
chapter without music the first time, and listen to the song afterwords.
Once they've absorbed the material, on subsequent reads they might well
choose to listen to the music during their read for the full experience.

Folks with the hardcopy and supplied CD would be likely to do something
similar, though I think listening to the CD for the first time through
would be more common.  Picking up a book is a different commitment to
visiting a web page.

I'd love to print out a paper copy to savor, but there
aren't any local print shops willing or able to print
HTML with Firefox.   

By chance, has anyone already done a conversation to
PDF?
