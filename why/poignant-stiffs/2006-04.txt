Subject: Notes on Chapter 3
Message-ID: <1db115340604041606ge3aeda1l4907662f1639a271@mail.gmail.com>

Hello!

The book is great and reads like a good novel. I am only on chapter 3,
 just one note so far: you do not explain how block arguments get into
a block. Ok, there is a block and there are parameters, but how actual
data is passed into a block?

Well, apparently, a non-stupid reader should deduce the idea from the
example you provided: ['toast', 'cheese', 'wine'].each { |food| print
food.capitalize }. I guess I am stupid. I flied through the above
example with ease (whoa, looks like a normal language), but stumbled
upon the similar piece of code later in the chapter:

 require 'net/http'
 Net::HTTP.start( 'www.ruby-lang.org', 80 ) do |http|
     print( http.get( '/en/LICENSE.txt' ).body )
 end

I guess, parentheses, arguments and different block syntax distracted
me ;-) It took several flips from one sample to another to grasp the
system: method returns a value that is fed to the following block. I
am only on Chapter 3 so I don't know is it possible to return multiple
values and if not, how to provide multiple parameters to a block.

Anyway, for the less bright readers you might want to mention how
exactly arguments are passed to a block.

Thanks again for the great read! I literally cannot stop reading.

Michael.

Perfect. Thanks a lot.
