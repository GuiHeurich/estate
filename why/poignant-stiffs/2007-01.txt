Yes, it's true.  Why's (Poignant) Guide to Ruby, the illustrated
manual which pays no mind to the prevailing notions of writing computer
lit, has a collectible set of mp3s.  Each song corresponds to a
chapter in the book.  You can listen while you read.  Or while you
eat.  Or even while you flex.

Parts I to VIII are here: <http://poignantguide.net/sdtrk/>

Thank you to Geoffrey Grossenbach, who continued to play my songs on
the Rails Podcast even when it wasn't the professional thing to do.
These songs are all licensed under the same terms as the book, so at
least I saved that guy some serious tuppence.

What is the reason for a soundtrack?

 * Well, music is essential for utmost poignancy, is it not??
 * Because computer books should NOT.  And so.
 * My clarinet needs a life too, let's not forget.

If I've wasted your time, then I'm sorry, geez, go find something
handy to do pronto!

This can only mean one thing: why must be working on the theatrical version next. Reserve your tickets now!

Yasushi Aoki has translated the ENTIRE poignant guide to Japanese
all of the sudden.  He is quite a dedicated translator, as he has
also done many articles from Steve Yegge, Joel Spolsky and Paul
Graham at his site http://www.aoky.net/.

As a token of my gratitude, Yasushi Aoki will be receiving some
original art from the book, delivered straight to his house, along
with some silkscreened prints of Camping advertissements.  What a
guy!

I finally had a chance to listen last night -- awesome work!

My current favorite is track II, all kinds of nice stuff happening.  And
the whole "early floyd" thing going on at the end is like, "Oh.  Whoa.
Yeah!"

(Incidentally, is there a deliberate Zelda reference in there?)
