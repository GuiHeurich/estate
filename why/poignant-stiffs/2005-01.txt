Subject: to_tex method for RedCloth
Message-ID: <41E35201.9040904@NASA.Gov>

I see DHH(?) hacked one into the RedCloth that comes
with instiki, viz,

  instiki-0.9.2/libraries/redcloth_for_tex.rb
  instiki-0.9.2/app/controllers/wiki.rb

Has anyone made a go on making this hack a part
of RedCloth proper and then on to wpgtr.to_tex and beyond?

(Psst: I am really pining for LaTeX output from the
YAML+RedCloth combo so I can flood our local
publication nuts with a new NASA Technical Memorandum
every time we change a word in our software's manual.)

Hi, list.

Sorry for the delay on the latest (Poigant) Guide chapter.  It's four 
weeks late already, I know.  Fortunately I have a few comics here to 
whet your appetites and momentarily appease you as I finish wrapping 
things up.

Part of the delay has been caused by a revamping of Chapter 3.  I've 
been redrawing all the comics and cleaning up the text for publication.  
That's right.  I'm told that Chapter 3 will be published in Joel 
Spolsky's year-end anthology of essays.  Titled: // comment.  He talks 
about it here: <http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2004/10/27.html>

With any luck, this will fall together so you can get a portion of the 
Guide in your hands soon enough.

I'd also like to thank Chris Pine for his extensive analysis of the 
Guide.  I've been reworking some instruction based on his comments and 
the critical analysis has been of soaring value.
