Wow, a completely animated chapter -- this is outstanding.  And it's
some of your best artwork yet.  I can't imagine how long this must
have taken.  Great work, why.

You have already been so helpful spreading word about the foxes and

maybe I can equip you to decorate the world with some of it --

Staple one to a telephone pole or paste onto the wall of a long

This can be printed through wallhogs.com, if you'd like x-tall.

If you are ill or not up for it, or if you have a broken foot, or if
all is not well with your next of kin or place of employ, I didn't

fact, my foot is breaking, too.

Any other sorts of other scenes you would like?

Err ...
Isn't there a way to have a kind of smaller resolution ?
Like ... say ... putting this hi-res scan on any flickr account ?

I will zip up a set of all the original scans.  I have been meaning
to do this to help the translators and PDF savants anyway.

WOOT! THAT'S AWESOME!

One question, though. Why are certain letters (mainly spoken by the 
rabbit) in this chapter just outlines?
 For example, in the last two rows, you've got "O k R q e t y Y h A G C 
S ! G ! H Y R W"

I also notice that that sequence of letters is an anagram for "eSq kAthy 
WHY CRY GROG!!"

Someone's playing games with our heads...

Don't you mean, "Why cry, Kathy Grog, Esq.?"

Clearly, this is foreshadowing.

Can I agree with you ?
Yup, it's a kind of "chef d'oeuvre" in the sense of wonderful,
enexpected, and totally bearded achievement

Subject: heya, helpful people, come quick!!
Message-ID: <20070301001040.GT61198@beekeeper.hobix.com>

Dear friends and watchers of the (Poignant) Guide, I have finally made
some headway on a secret project which some of you might enjoy
helping me with.  Like the Guide, it is disruptive, messy and will
hopefully help change this world of long, boring books and complicated
softwares.

Here's what I'm looking for:

 * People who use Windows
 * Who also are new to programming
 * (Or, who love programming)
 * And: that's it.
 * Oh, except, no leaking secrets out.

In short, if you like Try Ruby[1], you will really like this!!
Please just reply directly to me with whether you'd like to help
and maybe a bit about yourself so I know what level of programmer
you are.  Or if you know a friend who qualifies: YES.  Tell them.

Reclined in a defunct and truly obese satellite dish,

I'll give this a shot!

I am very interested in helping out. Why, to be honest (assuming many others
were also) I was drawn into Ruby after reading the poignant guide.  The
artwork and comedy captivated me like no other instructional book has
before. Prior to this moment, I have also felt that programming and the CS
field may not be my passion in life --actually I still feel that way, but
Ruby and the guide have certainly eased those fears.

I consider myself a young raw programmer with interest in eclectic Art and
Music. Unfortunately my current line of work is in the conservative,
Java-loving, defense industry so I feel I've been stifled compared to those
who use the latest technologies daily. My main goals for helping are: to be
involved in the Ruby community; inspire others to start using Ruby; and
become a more talented individual.

* I do use Windows
* I am fairly new to programming
* And I love Ruby --not so much Java :-[

Wish me luck,
~d.
