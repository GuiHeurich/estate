Hello, friends of the (poignant) guide.

While I have no (p)g news presently, you might plausibly be
interested in a side endeavor.  A short book with lots of the same
sorts of comics and cut-up pixels as you've seen before.

It's called "Nobody Knows Shoes."

I will leave it at that.  Except just to say that if you drive a
white Mazda with the lights on and the trunk open, I have already
left one for you, cozy with the spare tire.

Happy skate attack,

_why
