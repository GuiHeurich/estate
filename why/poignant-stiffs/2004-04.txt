Not to sound too sycophantic, but I think it's great. I've already 
recommended it (incomplete as it is) to several Ruby newbies. Plus, it's 
required reading for our local Ruby Users Group.

I know the Guide itself is licensed under a Creative Commons license. Is 
the ruby script that generates the lot under the same license, or 
something else?

I ask, because I'd like to use portions of it to build some 
documentation I'm writing (the new manual for the Copland IoC 
container). If it were just for my own internal use it wouldn't really 
matter, but I'd like to put the script in Copland's CVS as well as 
distribute it with the Copland source bundle.

Thanks,

Jamis

Yes, absolutely, it's all under the by-sa/1.0 license for now.  This 
includes the images, the text, the code.  Anything checked into CVS.

I'm really digging the YAML+Textile mix for writing and at some point 
I'd like to flesh out the format and give it a proper lib of its own. 


RedCloth will probably work in tandem with this new lib to provide a 
clean export to PDF, RTF.  That way we can still get the smart quotes 
and inline styles.

Sounds yummy! As I've been delving through the 100+ lines of code (very 
slick, btw) I was thinking, "gee, this ought to be generalized so others 
can take advantage of this." Glad to know that you're already thinking 
along those lines.

So, are you envisioning "to_pdf" and "to_rtf" methods on RedCloth, then, 
or something else?  Just curious how you see RedCloth working to produce 
PDF's, et. al.

I think so.  I haven't really wandered through the PDF librarys in RAA 
recently.  I used ClibPDF in Yod (a similiar documentation format).

So I'll probably use quite a bit of code from Yod (as it's got to_chm, 
to_man and to_pdf all covered):

http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/yaml4r/yaml4r/src/yod.rb?rev=1.22&view=auto

The problem will be flowing sidebars and left-aligned images in PDFs. 
Ideally, I'd like the new document lib to take RedCloth's PDF (or 
pseudo-PDF) output and finesse it into PDFs, but I can't conceptualize 
it yet because I can't recall all the details of generating PDFs.

I may even need the document lib to read the stylesheet, because I 
really want all the font sizes and borders (and possibly colors) to be 
preserved in the PDF.

Naturally, I'm open to any ideas and appeal to anyone who is a PDF monster.

Well, I'm no PDF monster. I haven't really touched PDF in a long time. 
However, at one point I played with a lot of diverse ways of generating 
PDF's.

Have you considered XML-FO?  It's one of the butt-ugliest file formats 
I've ever seen (and there is no Ruby solution for generating PDF's from 
XML-FO files, yet), but it is "style"-based (like HTML) and fairly 
flexible. There is the FOP processor at xml.apache.org which can be used 
to take an XML-FO file and build a PDF out of it.

On a completely different note: do you have a good reference for 
textile? The information at textism.com is pretty useless... :(
