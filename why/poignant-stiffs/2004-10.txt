I don't, as I learned it from Ruby in a Nutshell, written by Matz 
himself. I, like _why, prefer to see immediately when a call is being 
made to a class method as opposed to an instance method, because 
classes are special objects. The jump into another level of abstraction 
deserves to be treated differently, like a ticker-tape parade when you 
come home from war as opposed to just coming home from vacation.

But it's a stylistic preference, and I won't try to put your calls to 
class methods on a pedestal if you won't throw mine down from theirs.

Hello,
Would someone make a PDF version available?
I tried using an online HTMLDOC server do the conversion
but if truncated the images.
Much Thanks!
