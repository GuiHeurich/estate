Message-ID: <41059184.2030300@poignantguide.net>

Hello.  Thankyou for your waiting.  Testing, testing encrypted giraffe 
lungs.  (I'm having the elf feed him a few more bananas such that the 
words will slip-squizz out faster.)

  I am glad
  My arms
  Aren't too
  Long to
  Write a
  Book.

  Still,
  I wish
  They were
  Even a bit
  Closer.

The first expansion pak to the (Poignant) Guide is called The Tiger's 
Vest.  In chapter four, I am now asking the reader to branch away from 
the book for a moment to install Ruby.  And it's at:

   http://poignantguide.net/ruby/expansion-pak-1.html

These expansion paks are diversions, things which may change frequently 
and tell side stories and contain role-playing games.  Okay, back to 
chapter five.  Have some potion.

I ran in to all manner of problems following the tutorial on OS X 10.3 
(with the developer tools installed, not that it seems to make much 
difference). At first I wasn't sure why tab completion etc wasn't 
working in irb - then I figured it was certainly a readline problem. 
The 'ri' command line tool was no-where to be found. Then I remembered 
that it mentioend an upgraded version of ruby, so I grabbed the package 
from the page it linked to.

Unfortunately, the package installed 1.8 in /usr/local/bin - so now I 
have two versions of ruby installed:

164:~ simon$ /usr/bin/ruby -v
ruby 1.6.8 (2002-12-24) [powerpc-darwin7.0]
164:~ simon$ /usr/local/bin/ruby -v
ruby 1.8.1 (2004-03-15) [powerpc-darwin]

'ri' now works, but runs against the 1.8 libraries (as far as I can 
tell) while irb still uses 1.6. And readline support still doesn't work 
in either version! Very frustrating - I'd love a pointer to a way of 
fixing all of this.

I was also initially confused by the introduction of 'ri' - I tried 
typing ((Ri)) at the irb prompt and got nothing. It took me several 
more paragraphs of reading before I realised it was a command line 
tool. More clarification there would be nice :)

Other than the above, I thoroughly enjoyed it - though I was a little 
upset to see the Tiger lose his beloved Echelon 3500 again ;(

Cheers,

Hi Simon,

Have you ever used Darwin Ports? Highly recommended. The setup time is 
well worth the convenience it offers for installing new tools.

Get rid of the OS X version of Ruby and irb by renaming them:

sudo mv /usr/bin/ruby /usr/bin/ruby16
sudo mv /usr/bin/irb /usr/bin/irb16

Now restart your environment (i.e. close your terminal window and open 
a new one), and hack away with Ruby 1.8.

For irb completion, use this (in irb):
 >> require 'irb/completion'

That works with my version (darwin ports 1.8) of Ruby.

Hope that all helps,

-Chris

You crack me up, _why. Thanks for the great reading. First thing 
tomorrow, I'm sending a link to the expansion pak (and the rest of the 
poignant guide) to my entire office. They all know I'm a little fanatic 
about Ruby, but I'm hoping perhaps your book will entice a few more of 
them into the Right Way. :)

Thanks again!

Ah, yeah, I need to make sure this works right.  Do any other OS X users
have recommendations?  I'm not sure about the Darwin Ports suggestion
offered by Chris.  I'd like to find a binary package that works
precisely and harmlessly on the common Mac versions.

We'll turn this aright for you, Simon.

Thankyou, I've edited the Ri section with this in mind.

I've clarified a bit and hazed-down the curls.  I think it's better now.
Please, continued comments, continued needling of the text.  I want to
scare out the knots in the teaching.

Pitiful.  I don't know why he doesn't invest in some blast-off shoes of
his own.  I won't criticize him further, lest I make some off-putting
blanket statement about our vest-wearing populations.

A 1.8 pre-packaged distribution can be found here:
http://homepage.mac.com/discord/Ruby/

A readline bundle (required for the above distribution) is here:
http://cherryville.org/8896/ruby_readline_for_mac.html

I have not used either of these, so your mileage may vary.

Hi why & bunch!

This is what my irb told me, when I was so happy and had downloaded
the newest ruby from the net. It seems I lack some extras that weren't 
included in that big, round package that Windows installed, like a cat 
lapping milk.

Okay, I think I've got an answer to this.  Download:

  http://whytheluckystiff.net/ruby/dist/readline.so-for-1.8.zip

Two files inside.  Place readline.dll in $RUBY/bin.  The readline.so 
goes in $RUBY/lib/ruby/1.8/i386-mswin32.  Then, to get Irb working with 
Readline:

  irb --readline -r irb/completion

Try it and get back to me.  I'm sure Curt would put this in the Windows 
Installer.

...

Another alternative: http://www.rubygarden.org/ruby?FXIrb.  Completion 
could be hacked in by handling Fox::KEY_Tab in onKeyPress.

Anyone at all -- Do the OS X binaries come with Fox libraries?

No. Largely-untrod territory. I think there may be Fox packages in the
Fink distribution, but many OS X folks like to stay out of X11
entirely.

OK, I am herewith back. Tried it. Updated my "irb.bat" in the Start 
Menu, since I want the thing to work from there. (No point having a 
menu system if it ain't used.) After some trial'n error with the BAT 
file it bloody well worked!

Thanks. Tabbing the Ruby lang rocks so much. I am now going to try and 
get some web action from the Ruby thing, since that is what I aim at 
doing with it. Apart from the Call of Cthulhu Character Editor that is 
the Grail of all programming languages for me.

Yes, I was that elf for a little while, and I tabbed around, like a 
tab-mad pogostick.

Then I wanted to complete the steps of the Expansion kit. In essence, 
I needed to ri some commands. To wit:

irb(main):002:0> ri Enumerable#zip
NoMethodError: undefined method `ri' for main:Object
         from (irb):2
irb(main):003:0> ro
NameError: undefined local variable or method `ro' for main:Object
         from (irb):3
irb(main):004:0> ri
NameError: undefined local variable or method `ri' for main:Object
         from (irb):4
irb(main):005:0>

As you can tell, I even resorted to mistyping ri.

Is there any more magic to set this right?

Hi list,

OK, my troubles are yours. Here I go:

1. found an (Pragmatic Programmers) install version of ri. Also on 
RubyCentral.
http://www.rubycentral.com/downloads/ri.html

2. Read some README. Put the files where they wanted to be, after the 
install.rb script failed, it gave some type error.

3. Ran my irb and "ri rescue":
irb(main):001:0> ri rescue
SyntaxError: compile error
(irb):1: syntax error
         from (irb):1
irb(main):002:0>

It seems to me the files I added to Ruby are old in some way. Has the 
language deprecated a lot of parts of itself since 2002? End of my 
speculation.

(So you know: I uninstalled the Ruby-folder with the uninstaller 
before I installed the package from the Poignant Guide. I am using the 
new files. I am pretty sure.)

Olle,

You don't run ri from inside irb. You should run it from your appropriate command line. For instance 
on my Cygwin session (where $ is my prompt)

robertm@al ~
$ ri Enumerable#zip

--------------------------------------------------------- Enumerable#zip
     enum.zip(arg, ...)                   => array
     enum.zip(arg, ...) {|arr| block }    => nil
------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Converts any arguments to arrays, then merges elements of _enum_
     with corresponding elements from each argument. This generates a
     sequence of +enum#size+ _n_-element arrays, where _n_ is one more
     that the count of arguments. If the size of any argument is less
     than +enum#size+, +nil+ values are supplied. If a block given, it
     is invoked for each output array, otherwise an array of arrays is
     returned.

        a = [ 4, 5, 6 ]
        b = [ 7, 8, 9 ]

        (1..3).zip(a, b)      #=> [[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9]]
        "cat\ndog".zip([1])   #=> [["cat\n", 1], ["dog", nil]]
        (1..3).zip            #=> [[1], [2], [3]]

Oh, hello Robert (and the rest of you)!

Thanks. So much. I did some discovering, and found you right. But 
without your email to remove my preconceptions, I would've wasted more 
time. Thanks so much, this is very well.

Proof:

C:\Documents and Settings\olle>ri eval
------------------------------------------------------------ Kernel#eval
      eval(string [, binding [, filename [,lineno]]])  => obj
------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Evaluates the Ruby expression(s) in _string_. If _binding_ is
      given, the evaluation is performed in its context. The binding may
      be a +Binding+ object or a +Proc+ object. If the optional
      _filename_ and _lineno_ parameters are present, they will be used
      when reporting syntax errors.

         def getBinding(str)
           return binding
         end
         str = "hello"
         eval "str + ' Fred'"                      #=> "hello Fred"
         eval "str + ' Fred'", getBinding("bye")   #=> "bye Fred"

This whole saga is reduce to a tiny dent in the expansion pak now.  And 
sounds like Curt Hibbs is improving the win install to make it easy.  
The OS X situation still needs improving I think.

Simon, how is your Irb?  Any better?

Sadly not - I haven't found a way of getting readline working with Ruby 
1.8.1 yet :( I'll try to have another play over the weekend.

What he said: Yeah, go and vote.

Seven strong advocates, already. Let's ad-vo-cate that thing.

I now understand how strong a platform that Poignant Guide can be for 
your cause, why (or should I say Muad'Dib?).

I just want that feature, is all.

Hi all,
Why, I have inserted the commands you have told us in pak-1 to memorize
to ~/.irbrc: "require 'irb/completion'", I think it's good for people who
don't want to memorize too many things and it works automaticly without typing
a too long command, what do you think?

I hope irb's tab completion will become friendlier to users and programmers
of Ruby in the near future, it is a great feature.

The simplest way I've found is to use ruby from darwinports 
(http://darwinports.opendarwin.org/) or fink (http://fink.sf.net).  
I've built my own with readline support, but it involved compiling a 
new readline library, as I recall.
