Message-ID: <b244e1b2050309135618001c1@mail.gmail.com>

This is totally off-topic I know.

I was reading the Cyberiad the other day and was struck by the humming
echos between the Poignant's more fantastical passages and Lem's fine,
fine work.  "The Third Sally, or the Dragons of Probability" in
particular, but perhaps "The First Sally (A), (etc)" in which our
cybernetic constructors attempt to make a poetry writing machine by
first similuatating all of creation in order to have sufficient depth
of experience.

Any connection _why?  You wouldn't happen to be a native polish speaker...?

Sorry for the late reply.  Just getting through my e-mail now.

I don't speak any Polish.  But, whenever I can, I try to write with a 
Polish accent.  In fact, my name in full -- which reads: why the lucky 
stiff -- is Polish for "an eight-nine year old man wearing too small of 
a backpack stuffed with clocks."

You know what?  I love that book.  I've got proof even:
<http://www.whytheluckystiff.net/ruby/rubyconf.2002/panel.2.2-yaml/rSlide-14.html>

Of the Lem books I've read, that one is by far my favorite.  The sixth 
sally (or How Trurl and Klapaucius Created a Demon of the Second Kind to 
Defeat the Pirate Pugg) is among one of my favorite stories ever.  Right 
next to probably The Laughing Man (by J.D. Salinger) and TV People (by 
Haruki Murakami).  I think I like The Cyberiad because it's more of a 
short story collection.  I often prefer short story collections to books.

So, yeah, I consider myself heavily influenced by slavic literature.  
Gogol and Kafka and Kharms (and anything Oberiu) hold the lion's share 
in my mind's governing committee.  If have more Polish authors, please.

Message-ID: <424197BA.9050001@poignantguide.net>

Since you were a very young rabbit in little cotton pants, Dwemthy's 
Array has breathed on your neck and you're tired of it.  You draw your 
glistening Hero's Sword from its sheath and cut a low-circling falcon in 
half as a confidence building exercise.  Your eyes flick about in a cool 
and freaky way.

You're ready...  It's time to stare this construct in the face.

$$$ DWEMTHY_S ARRAY ^!^ A RUBY MINI_DUNGEON ^!^ CODE TO KILL BY $$$

Here, try this: http://poignantguide.net/dwemthy/

The sixth chapter of Why's (Poignant) Guide to Ruby is on its way.  This 
chapter covers metaclasses and method_missing with the help of Dwemthy's 
demonic list.  The code for the little RPG is now available.  A full 
explanation is forthcoming in chapter six.

Please send your hacks to the poignant-stiffs list.  Subscription 
information is at http://poignant.rubyforge.org/.

See, that code is possessed.  Earlier, before I put up the site, I was 
testing things and I happened to look at the page through a 
blood-encrusted spyglass and _that very code_ vanished when I did so.

It really affected me, really spooked me out, so I locked up all my dogs 
and cockatiels out in the shed, barring the door twice.  Then, later, 
when I got back from jazz dance, I opened the shed and the place was 
covered in roach blood -- my pets were all huddled together, keeping 
each other warm -- and there in the center of the room... was a DETACHED 
TERMINAL WINDOW (vt100).

It had one of Dwemthy's IRC sessions in it and the screen was full of 
trout slaps.  I screamed at full volume.

It's the equivalent of taking a shallow breath in the ocean.  Oh, and I 
have asthma.  I hope I've made that painfully clear.

Thankyou for venturing into the hazards of Dwemthy's Array, Karen.  If 
you like the game, a link on del.icio.us would do well...  Or e-mail it 
to a friend...

Or some have promised ewe cheese and Vietnamese donuts just this week.

Subject: Where's the magick???
Message-ID: <f38b43ef050323181323a4f93c@mail.gmail.com>

So I have my little rabbit, and he's got all this charisma (he's
thinking of running for prez, but first he's got this labor union of
monsters to stomp on). Occasionally I noticed he was getting [magick
powers up!] and I wondered if that would get him more votes in the
future. Looking at the code, though, it's just one of those misleading
exit poll thingies, run by no other than Dwemthy himself, sent to
raise my little guy's hopes (he's going to run on the "but I'm a cute
bunny... who wouldn't trust me?!?" platform) and then dashes them to
the ground.

And, you see, he can't take this, since his brother's about to get
eaten... so don't forget to http://savetoby.com/ !

Vote for the little guy! And give him some p_up already!

Dwemthy is not responsible for this.  He is in supreme outrage.  He is 
swinging his mace and shield around in cavalier fashion.  His lions 
aren't happy as well.  He's playing heavy metal way too loud.  His 
neighbors are banging on the wall.  Seriously, his speakers are shot.  
It's like metal dogs are screaming at welding equipment.

I like you.  Come, let's be brothers.

Watch it take me upwards of 48 hours to work up an increment operation.  
Looks like I've got to go back and get my tools out.  Gheesh, beaver 
tales already.

Subject: eval-less, send-less Creature.traits bleeds lemony goodness
Message-ID: <1112218593.424b1be1d8151@www.rydia.net>

Here's a version of Creature.traits from Dwemthy's Array that uses
define_method (without requiring send):

  def Creature.traits(*arr)
    return @traits if arr.empty?
    attr_accessor *arr
    arr.each do |a|
      (class << self ; self ; end).instance_eval {
        define_method(a) {|val|
          @traits ||= {}
          @traits[a] = val
        }
      }
    end
    class_eval {
      define_method(:initialize) {
        self.class.traits.each do |k,v|
          instance_variable_set("@#{k}", v)
        end
      }
    }
  end

I much prefer this to using eval -- the key was the discovery that
instance_eval/class_eval capture local variables.

Look good, or can someone improve on this?

Well, of course I meant string evals.  Block evals don't count.

Yes, that's it. >_>  <_<
