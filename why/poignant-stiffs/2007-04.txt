Hi,

I was rereading the Poignant Guide again for like the 80th time today
and discovered that the preeventualist.org site is down. I know this
isn't something you can directly affect but it does kind of ruin your
examples in chapter 6. Maybe you can let the Preeventualist Youth
Group know or recommend them a good hosting service?

Ethan

Friends of the (Poignant) Guide,

Any of you remember that /SECRET PROJECT/ from the beginning of March?
I needed some folks using Windows to shell out some precious time to
see if I could help them learn Ruby.

The secret project is: Hackety Hack.  It's a Windows program for
learning Ruby with lots of fun examples: downloading mp3s, writing
blogs, chatware, and so on.

AND, WELL, >>MOTHER CAREY'S CHICKENS<< IT WORKED!!

I ended up with 50 participants, about half stuck with it and we saw
some amazing progress.  I've asked the participants to blog about
their experiences, here are the first few:

 * http://www.greaterbostonrubyandrails.com/HacketyHackBlog.html
 * http://ostracons.com/entry/272/programmed
 * http://willscott.name/2007/04/23/HacketyHack

Thankyou to the fine, fine people who applied themselves to make
this happen.  It was one of those beautiful, unforgettable times
that really changed my life!!  Truly adventure-sized!!

I should also mention that Brian DeLacey, who has been an
instrumental force in building Hackety Hack (and whose three young
kids have been learning Ruby as we speak,) will be showcasing
H-ety H in Boston:

  This next meeting will be on Tuesday, May 8th from 7 to 9pm at 1
  Broadway St, Kendall Square, Cambridge.

  We plan to spend about 45 minutes on an introductory demonstration
  and discussion of _why's latest creation, Hackety Hack. The tour
  will be led by a tag-team of beta testers (including Eric Mill,
  Kevin Driscoll and Brian DeLacey) who have been using this since
  early March.

Oh, wow, Eric Mill and Kevin D. as well.  These guys _get_ HH!!  If
you see them at the meeting, jog their hands fiercely and say THANKS
to them!!

hi _why!

Will the source for Hackety Hack be opened.  I would love to see how
it is implemented, and do crazy shit with it.  Like support for JRuby,
or Lisp.  I dunno, but it would be cool!

Sounds nice. I tried to install it using Wine on Ubuntu (Feisty Fawn)
GNU/Linux, and it installs but then doesn't work properly. It says
"uninitialized constant Camping". Nope, I haven't installed camping on
my computer, should I? Do you think it will work on Ubuntu?

Thanks,

Is the registration turned off? HH told me to signup but all I got was a
white page that told me that there was no user called signup.
