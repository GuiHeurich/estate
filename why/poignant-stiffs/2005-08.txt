First, go to the printable copy:

http://poignantguide.net/ruby/print.html

Then, depending on your operating system, you should be able to spool the
print job either to PDF or PostScript (which can then be converted to PDF,
though most print shops should be able to handle PostScript as well).

Under Windows:

Select "Print" then, in the Print dialog box, select "Print to File"
and save the file as wpgtr.ps. Then, if you have Acrobat Distiller or
Acrobat installed, you can use one of those tools to turn the file into
a PDF; if not, I am sure there are a plethora of free tools, but I cannot
recommend one for you.

Under Mac OS X:

Select "Print" then, in the Print dialog box, select "Save as PDF..."
It should be pretty self-explanatory from here on out.

Under your favorite Linux/BSD/Solaris/Whatever:

Select "Print" then, in the Print dialog box, select "Print to File"
and save the file as wpgtr.ps. Then, you can run pstopdf or pd2pdf
(at least one of these comes as part of the xpdf package) in order to
produce a PDF file. The details of installing the xpdf package if you
don't have it are left as an exercise to the reader.  Warning: When I
tried this with the xpdf out of backports on Debian woody, the images
lost resolution, though everything was still legible.

-

If teaching you how to fish is failing for some reason, I'd be happy
to go through this process myself and put a PDF up for you. I would
do it on my Mac, if only because Macs speak PDF as a first language,
while my Linux machine is clearly still learning.

Hope this helps,

-r.

I have, right here. I actually proofread the damn thing all the way  
through to get the page breaks right (Firefox printed nastily, only  
Safari was nice and it didn't process page break css directives).  
Then I manually inserted page breaks so as to ensure the page doesn't  
cut off text or end a sidebar right at the top of the page, or break  
a page in half. It represents about 5 hours work.

Thank you!

For completeness, here's a recommendation for a free Windows PDF creation
program:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdfcreator/

It acts a printer driver, so instead of printing to file and then running
the application on the postscript file, you print to the PDF Creator
printer, and get a PDF out. This has the same problems as the pstopdf
method with regard to losing image quality (I assume because they are
both based on the same version of GhostScript).

Interestingly, the commercial product Acrobat Distiller also has these
problems; I'll have to try on my Mac (which lives at home, while I am
at work, or I would do it now) and see if those problems happen there too.

Good people, I've just come back from a fantastic adventure at OSCON, 
where I was allowed to fiddle with my computer and hack Ruby code in 
front of a large audience.  It was an experiment I'm proud of, a live 
version of the emotions and mnemomics I've been stockpiling in the 
(Poignant) Guide.

I'm placing the videos on a BitTorrent tracker:

I thought you might want to know.  If you like what you're reading or 
hearing about the performances at FOSCON and OSCON, consider coming to 
RubyConf in San Diego.  I'll be playing an offsite show that weekend, 
more details to come.  The agenda itself looks fantastic:

Message-ID: <42F80565.1010308@cYcnus.de>

Hi!

I like to present an obfuscated Ruby script dedicated to the Two Foxes and their
Funny Phrase:

http://ruby.cycnus.de/chunky_bacon.rb

Zoom out to watch the gag :-Y

It runs a WEBrick server, and if you now visit http://localhost:203, you have
your browser window filled with CB. http://localhost:203/200 gives you even more
CB, http://localhost:203/10000 might crash your system (if you are on Windows.)
CB overflow.

By the way: port 203 seems to be "AppleTalk Unused"; I declare it to be the
Chunky Bacon port from now on. 0xCB == 203.

I hope your browser supports "position: fixed"; at least Firefox does.

Thanks to why for the image, RMagick for the Ascii-art, Ruby herself for
creating the obfuscated code.

If the triumphal procession of CB goes on, it may be more famous than Ruby one
day. Books will be written, RPGs will be invented, commercials and movie
trilogies will pop up everywhere; maybe you can study ChunkyBaconology in 10 years!

Ruby changed the world.

For you, Why, anything. I'd also like to take the opportunity to come  
out of my little lurker box to thank you profusely for doing such a  
thing. (The rest of you may scroll down to the location of the  
files). Undertaking a task such as mine for any other work would  
inevitably leave me with a deep and abiding hatred for the author and  
subject matter, but I find myself closer to Poignicity than ever before.

I have to admit something, Why. I've been stalking you. Rummaging  
through your garbage. Reading your stories. Tapping your phone  
conversations. I'm quite tall, at 6 feet, 6 inches, with long dark  
hair; you may have spotted me out of the corner of your eye as you  
were writing another RedHanded post, or maybe when you were working  
on the new CSS for the guide.

And here's the reason: your writing is far, far too addictive. And,  
despite all your blogs and all of your archives and six chapters of  
the guide (beautifully page-breaked), the cravings aren't going away,  
no matter how many RSS feeds I throw at it, no matter how many  
Googled mailing list archives, I desire more. I need it.

So, here's the rub: having a soundtrack, and a new blue thing around  
the pages, and everything, is all really spiffy, sure. But I'd kill  
for you, Why, if you would put chapter seven up there. Or even part  
of the chapter, you know, kind of beta-book-ey? If it follows the  
same pattern as the last one's, it's probably even longer. I know  
what creative procrastination looks like, because that's what I spend  
most of my time doing and spend the rest of my time hating myself for  
it.

I've introduced many friends, programmers and non-programmers;  
professors, even god help me, parents to your little poignant guide.  
They snapped it up, you see, and got addicted, just like you wrote,  
just like you warned us all little smotchkkisses. Don't hold out on  
us now, man! We want to do all of those cool things you promised.

And we'll work for it, too. This little pagebreaking extravaganza is  
just the beginning of the tireless work I and many others like me  
(who are reading this very sentence on the mailing list!) will do.  
We'll happily solve little problems, proofread, recruit music  
artists, talk to publishers, maintain forums, test out examples, even  
impersonate your signature for autographs. We'll take care of all the  
mundane crap. What we all want *you* to do, Why, is write! Write down  
those fantastic worlds of word inside your head and share them,  
because we all want to play in them. Delegate to your loyal legions  
of smotchkkisses that you created, that you trained, and that are  
addicted to your very words!

Keep this in mind, and you'll always remember why, Why, you're the  
luckiest of all stiffs.

The files may be found here. Each chapter is there, along with  
guide.pdf, which is the joining together of all the chapters. The  
individual files are of higher quality, but you only have to download  
one file. The classic conundrum. You are all free to share the files  
of course, but please, don't share the links. I've gotten enough  
notice from the administrators, thank you.
