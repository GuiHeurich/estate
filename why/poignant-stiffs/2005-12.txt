Very, very cool. It seems to not be working too well with konqueror
(3.5 on kubuntu with kde 3.5) unfortunatley (thankfully i can use
firefox). Anyway very poignant. Why, you really are a legend.

paz y amor,

Does anyone know where i can get some well written but very simple
ruby programs, so that i can read thru the source and try and figure
out how they work?

paz y amor,

Hello.

Perhaps i'm completly and utterly wrong, but i think
AnimalLottoTicket's constructor can never work.

[excerpt]
   def initialize( note1, note2, note3 )
     if [note1, note2, note3].uniq!
       raise ArgumentError, "the three picks must be different notes"
     elsif picks.detect { |p| not NOTES.include? p }
       raise ArgumentError, "the three picks must be notes in the
chromatic scale."
     end
     @picks = picks
     @purchased = Time.now
   end
[/excerpt]

picks will of course be nil, will it not? perhaps something like
picks = [note1, note2, note3]
is missing?

Anyway, thanks for the guide. A good read.
Helmar++

Before i forget it, i was missing some kind of explanation of the
array method detect's functionality. Other than that, very well
explained.

I'm now reading the next chapter and your regexp explanation.
[snip]
See, deer language. The \d represents a digit. It's a place holder in
the regexp for any type of number. The regexp will now match T-1000,
T-2000, all the way up to T-9000.
[/snip]
Shouldn't it say, the regexp will now match T-0000, T-1000, all the
way up to T-9000?

I'm not on any other lists where so many incoming messages look so
much like spam -- the subject lines always come out *so* kooky! I
always spend that puzzled moment trying to figure out which universe
this message must have come from...

If it weren't for the Ruby code that inevitably appears, I wouldn't
get much help from the message body either!

(This observation is no commentary on Helmar or any poster -- it's the
nature of this crazy beast.)

I think the weekly ruby programming quiz would be pretty close to what
you're looking for. Here they are online, check out the archives on
the left column of the page for various elegant solutions:

http://www.rubyquiz.com/

Let us know if you're looking for something even more simple.
