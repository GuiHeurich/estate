Hi _why!

    Or shall I say, "Why, Hello!"?

    I would love to try out new and potentially messy stuff.
Background... I'm a:

*  propeller-head geek programming for about 30 years, in languages such as:
    APL, Basic, C, Forth, PostScript, RenderMan, C++, Perl, Tcl, AutoIt3,
    Ruby, Common Lisp, and now D.  (So I really enjoy programming.)
*   After starting out on unix-like systems, I lately find myself always 
running WinXP
     because of the apps that I need to run.
*   I can keep a secret.

    If there's anything else you would like to know, fire away.

    Thanks!
-- Glenn Lewis

Hot, sticky thanks to everyone who phoned in yesterday and accepted
a small role helping out with the secret project.  These are fine
people who often receive little-to-no recognition for their speedy
replysmanship and who live in little huts off in a foggy, foggy,
foggy forest.  They drive carrot cars and get in all these cute,
harmless accidents, etc.  You get the picture.

At any rate, I'm writing to say that the slots are full.  I will
say again if I end up needing more help, but this'll do nicely for
now.  Cheery-oh!
