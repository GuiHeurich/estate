Hello,

I'm a total noob with Ruby so I coulld easily be missing something but on
section 7 of chapter 5 there is the defintion of a WishScanner. Then in the
next example you have a

include MindScanner

I think that's maybe supposed to be

include WishScanner

And the sentences below maybe should be talking about a WishScanner being
mixed into the MindReader?
