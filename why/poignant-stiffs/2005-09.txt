Message-ID: <43229522.6020703@gmail.com>

Hi, my name is Kang Chang Ki.
I'm a member of Ruby Korean Document Project.
You can check it out at: http://wiki.rubykr.org/show/KoreanDoc
We are helping people who want to learn Ruby by translating English or
Japaness writings into Korean.

One of our readers email us to tell us we should translate that famous
guide into Korean about 1 month ago.
So we tried to figure out the email address of the writer but we couldn't.
Please let us know the email address of the writer.

Kang Chang Ki.

Hi,

One of the many addresses _Why is using is why@whytheluckystiff.net ...
But, on this page (http://rubyforge.org/mail/?group_id=183) you'll also
find the poignant-translators mailing list which you definitively should
be a member of ;)

He, me too. :P 
I plan to start the brazilian portuguese translation, and it was good
to hear about the translators list (there are only *two* lists on the
book main page ;-)). Oh, it was good to hear about the korean
translation too.

Chunky bacons for you all.
