a kind offer, thankyou.  as for obstacles: the flow of images and 
sidebars could make some editions difficult to build.  fortunately, this 
is a strength of css.  i truly respect its cooperation in this regard.  
pdf won't be so cooperative.

currently, the images checked into cvs are 800px wide.  but i'd really 
like to keep 300dpi or 600dpi images somewhere in cvs so that nicely 
printed versions could be produced.

can anyone suggest a good resolution for these master images?  what 
image depth would you like to see in the pdf version?

Chapter Four of my ongoing Ruby book is done, done, walk on, walk on. 

I know this chapter was supposed to be six months in the making, but 
what can I say?  I looked at it today and said, "Yeah, that's good."

Here's a link directly to the chapter:

help tease this thing along.

Hi,

Ok, so maybe I'm suffering because I live in OS X land. Tonight when I 
get the chance to drop into Linux I will try to reproduce this on a 
different OS. Using Ruby 1.8, complete with the 0.6 version of the YAML 
library and the current versions of erb (2.0.4) and redcloth (2.0) from 
the RAA, I get the following error when I run "ruby poignant.rb" on the 
CVS tree:

/sw/lib/ruby/1.8/yaml.rb:39:in `load': parse error on line 1162, col 4: 
`    - !^sidebar' (ArgumentError)
         from /sw/lib/ruby/1.8/yaml.rb:39:in `load'
         from poignant.rb:11:in `load'
         from poignant.rb:71

(the /sw prefix you see in front of everything is the fink sandbox. 
Think of it as the /usr/local of OS X)

I've taken a quick look at the libraries and at the poignant.yml file. 
None of the other sidebars fail to load correctly, the libraries seem 
to be up to date, and I'm wondering if anyone has ideas on how to 
proceed.

On a different note, I'm using anonymous CVS access at RubyForge. I've 
made an account, but does CVS access work for project contributors? I 
can't check out the project using my RubyForge login.

Thanks,

Chris

Another inspired chapter from the master of Ruby prose. :)  Thanks, _why_!

However, one gripe, and I'm afraid it's a tough one... the art work, 
though wonderful, is a real strain to read. :(  I found myself getting 
mildly frustrated tring to decipher the text in strips.  It's not 
difficult, it's just more time-consuming than I would like.  The wild 
fonts are great decoration, and from an artistic perspective I really 
like them, but when I'm trying to read them, it really slows me down.

I saw a few typos, too, but didn't mark them.  :)  I'll do a second 
read-through later and post the ones I catch.

Just committed Chapter Four to CVS.  Try it out.

If you continue to have errors, there may be some YAML in there that's 
triggering a bug that's been fixed in Ruby CVS.  Quite a bit has been 
debugged from 1.8.0 to 1.8.1 and 1.8.1 to the present.

It's all sort of leafy and overgrown I suppose.  I didn't think of this, 
but now that you've pointed out the problem I can't tolerate it at all.  
I'll tame down these letters and see if I can improve the scans.

Hi,

I just finished building wpgtr from the CVS source on my local machine. 
First, the OS: Mac OS X 10.3 with dev tools and fink installed.

Next, the Ruby installation:
Ruby Stable Snapshot (available from http://ruby-lang.org)
Redcarpet CVS (available from http://sourceforge.net/projects/yaml4r/)
erb 2.0.4 (available from http://raa.ruby-lang.org/list.rhtml?name=erb)

You can not build wpgtr using earlier versions of the packages I listed 
above.

Finally, the build (with bugs?):
You need to create a target directory. I used wpgtr/html/
Enter the command "ruby poignant.rb html/" to build the book in the 
wpgtr/html/ directory.

You need to specify a build location, or the copy commands in ftools.rb 
library will clobber your guide.css and every image in wpgtr/i/. It is 
sad when that happens.

Maybe something like this should go into a README file?

And it's probably just me but

starmonkey = ratchet.attach( captive_monkey, pipe.catch_a_star ) + 
deco_hand_frog

makes me twitchy. I know the + is a method but that hasn't been 
explained yet. How about:


starmonkey = ratchet.attach( captive_monkey, pipe.catch_a_star )
starmonkey.left_hand.glue(deco_hand_frog)

?


You can even show how to smash those together:

ratchet.attach( captive_monkey,
pipe.catch_a_star).left_hand.glue(deco_hand_frog)

Ugh. Actually maybe not, that's a bit confusing
(plus there's no starmonkey to grab hold of)...

+1 for the Jesus Jones reference though!

okay.  that might work nicely.  i have largely been ignoring methods 
which act as properties so far in the book.  while operator methods get 
quite a bit of show time in chapter four.  referring to 
'starmonkey.left_hand' might help prep that discussion.

what does everyone think of the two above examples?

Blixy Tees.  Six hi-quality shirts featuring a few highlights of the

cutouts.  And a medley of "chunky bacon" panels that will have the other

Seriously, how great is the Internet?  You can buy t-shirts advertising

* Tomas Jogin - http://jogin.com/weblog/archives/000502/
   so Tomas told me that he was only reading the Guide for the comics.  
he said he didn't want to learn Ruby, but it looks like Ruby's gonna 
take its prey.  dying to see how this sort of thing plays out.

* Bret Pettichord - 
http://www.io.com/~wazmo/blog/archives/2004_03.html#000071
   the Guide as a trap for non-proggies.  and: will they make it through 
the code examples?

* Ned Batch Elder - 
http://www.nedbatchelder.com/reactor/comment.php?entryid=e20040223T211359
   a variety of reactions.  admittedly, i can see how the structure of 
the instruction could really get under someone's skin.  i guess before i 
started, i sort of felt like taming everything down.  but really, what's 
the point in that?  i just don't feel like exercising a whole lot of 
restraint at the moment.  it's an experiment. and truthfully: not really 
up to snuff with most other literature out there.

Give this line to one of the foxes.

It may make sense in German, but in English, you don't stick negative 
numbers at the end of a sentence.

Have you ever heard the phrase "each one teach one?" it means that whenever 
someone teaches you something, you should turn around and teach some one 
else what you learned. That concept has the same meter as what you have 
here. Use it.

Python is cleaner here, because it overfocuses on iterators at the expense 
of support for blocks. So you need a good block example later sell the 
Python folks.

Actually, the OP is spreading snake oil. His Python code is also 
syntactically correct Ruby:

dave[~ 21:47:10] irb
irb(main):001:0> def eat(food)
irb(main):002:1>   puts "Yum: #{food}"

Yum: toast

Subject: the continuing adventures of one frail and very slow author with
 achy joints
Message-ID: <40574CC4.3050508@poignantguide.net>

just checking in to let everyone know that the fifth chapter is going 
really well.  i think the fourth chapter met my expectations of digging 
into Ruby and moving the plot along.  things start to get quite busy in 
the next two chapters and, by end of chap 6, you should feel fully 
immersed in a deep, tangled wilderland of assorted animals, do-gooders, 
and smoky corridors.  i'm tempted to flash you some imagery from 
chapters five and six (which I've been working on side-by-side), but I 
really want the whole thing to spill out on to your lap at once.

this is wonderful.  once these chapters are out, i'll be at the halfway 
point.

chapter five won't be ready until april.  i'm sorry about this.  i have 
vacation all through next week and i intend to leave the writing alone 
for the time and concentrate on feeling air currents and adjusting the 
strap on my backpack.

surprisingly, the site is still going so strong.  i believe we owe that 
to being #2 on google for the word 'poignant'.  hopefully the guide can 
become the exclusive home to poignancy on web.  no one will feel a thing 
without checking the site first.

thanks to everyone who has bought shirts.  i ordered an 'addiction' 
shirt [1] to check the quality and it's really nice actually.  you can 
tell they did it with a transfer if you look closely, but the colors and 
dots are well done.

== now, a question ==

i would like to include some basic reference materials with the guide.  
here are a few ideas i've had.  you can vote or propose as you please:

* flash cards.

               SIDE A                              SIDE B

   [ 'bear', 'rabbit', 'racoon']        caterpillar stapled into code is
                                                  AN ARRAY


   :fizz                                     antacid with bubbles is
                                                  A SYMBOL

   YukihiroMatsumoto               capital letters, it is specific, 
unchanging,
                                                 A CONSTANT

...illustrations on side B.

* a reference poster with a block of code, dissected into parts like the 
above, with illustrations.

* oggs of verbal drills and memory songs.

* costumes which could be made entirely from a roll of tin foil.

* yo-yo tricks, sleights-of-hand which illustrate iteration, mixins.

alright, then.  i hear ya.  a mix of it.  a musical for salt-dough hand 
puppets to be performed from a bathtub with curtains.  well done!

For what it's worth: ever seen the Dialectizer?  It'll translate the 
Guide into Jive, Redneck, or any of several other dialects.  Might help 
get to some of those hard-to-reach demographics...

It's worth a grin, anyway. ;)

cheerio.  just been getting back from vacation.  was very nice, thankyou.

getting back, here's the question primary on my mind:

  'can you foresee any reason you wouldn't recommend the Guide as the #1 
starting point for a Ruby newcomer?'

i can understand not recommending it as it is incomplete.  but so far, 
does the book meet your criteria for instructing a newcomer?  are the 
topics being covered in an intuitive manner?  do you like the order they 
are being presented?  do you feel it is the premier launchpad for a learner?
