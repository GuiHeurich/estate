I just finally checked this account after months, and found 99% spam, 
and this.

I'm a newbie to programming and to Ruby, so maybe I'm a good test?  My 
only coding background is with XSLT, and I work with a lot of text and 
XML (I'm a scholar).

I find I learn by doing more than anything, with well-explained, 
complete (no code fragments please), and practical examples.  So useful 
stuff for me would be something like:

I want to download an article (or group of them) from the New York 
Times, run Tidy to convert to XHTML, and run a regex-based text cleaner 
on it to convert "dumb quotes" to <q>semantic quotes</q>.

That deals with working with files, it deals with the web-related 
stuff, and with regular expression support.

I'd also like to learn how to create a simple command-line interface to 
do some of this sort of stuff.

Beyond that, I think the writing tends too-often towards being -- sorry 
to be blunt -- pretentious.  As you write (and I make my living 
writing, so do this myself), ask yourself whether you are communicating 
what you need to communicate in the most direct way.

One of the charming points of W(P)GtR is that it's not a typical 
programming manual -- which is to say, it's not direct, it's 
entertaining.  I can say that for non-programmers (well, for me) the 
Guide is pretty damn powerful -- it doesn't just tell you how Ruby 
works, it makes you want to know.  I have very little interest in or 
aptitude for programming and I had to pull myself away from learning the 
language because I had too much other stuff to do.

(By the way, I wrote up W(P)GtR in a ridiculously hyperbolic everything2 
node -- http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1669460 )

I have to agree with Ben here. I am a programmer (as a living, not so
much as a hobby) and my language of choice is Ruby. Probably the very
most bestest thing about W(P)GtR is the writing style!

It is entertaining and funny, and its eclectic nature lends strongly to
that. There are so many learn-Ruby guides out there for the
non-programmer and more serious ones for those who need a course (the
interactive online Programming Ruby book is what I put the students
through ;).

It is *so* nice to have something that is *not* one of those dry,
overly-communicative, too-direct sources without any attempt at Art. [
Yes, I said attempt, I'll decide later if W(P)GtR is Art or
not...maybe...part of the amusement. ]

It would be fun if:
(1) it could be a little less to the point, perhaps through additional
indirection
(2) there existed a leather-bound version, with a well worn cover

Or not.

Note: I am not saying ti should be dry.  I don't have time to give 
examples now, but maybe when the next chapter is out I'll pick out a 
few to demonstrate what I mean.

I doubt you're in the intended audience. More probably in the intended
audience is someone like my wife, who's brilliant but hasn't explored
much programming because she can't be bothered with jargon, which I
think (and she thinks) _why does a fine job of dispatching (as in
getting rid of it, not as in double-dispatch, of course).

I also think the label "silly" would apply more aptly than
"pretentious", if only because the text is so cheery. To my mind, the
world has enough "Learn XQHKELMNOP In 12 Seconds" and not enough "How
is XQHKELMNOP Like Milking a Cow?"

All that said, I haven't found the time to go back and read the whole
thing; it probably could stand to be a bit more of a page-turner...

Hey All,

Apologies if this isn't a proper forum for this--pls feel free to redirect
me...

I can't get ri to work.  I'm on winxp.  Googling led me to change my path,
but it seems like the problem is that bin\ri.bat wants me to have a T: drive
mapping, which I don't, and don't know where that should be mapped in any
event.

Does this sound familiar to anyone?

Thanks!

-Roy

Hello.  Thankyou for your waiting.  Testing, testing encrypted giraffe 
lungs.  (I'm having the elf feed him a few more bananas such that the 
words will slip-squizz out faster.)

  I am glad
  My arms
  Aren't too
  Long to
  Write a
  Book.

  Still,
  I wish
  They were
  Even a bit
  Closer.

The first expansion pak to the (Poignant) Guide is called The Tiger's 
Vest.  In chapter four, I am now asking the reader to branch away from 
the book for a moment to install Ruby.  And it's at:

   http://poignantguide.net/ruby/expansion-pak-1.html

These expansion paks are diversions, things which may change frequently 
and tell side stories and contain role-playing games.  Okay, back to 
chapter five.  Have some potion.
