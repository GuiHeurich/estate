I haven't put out the soundtrack in its entirety yet, but the three-part 
song which goes with chapter 6 was heard by Raymond Brigleb, who runs 
Noboto.com.  He made a music video for the song and it can be found at 
the conclusion of his latest interview variety show.

It's right here: http://noboto.com/16/noboto-13

Good stuff, man.  Good stuff.

I'm looking forward to a separate MP3.  It is a nice song to play along
to also.

I'm sorry but no one has commit rights at the moment.  I'm working on a

Ad _why,

As explained previously I've done some little changes to allow
localization and so ....
As I finished the translation of the 3rd chaprter tonight, I'm going to
commit it to Rubyforge CVS, in the wpgtr-intl module, in order for you
to review it, just to know if it's ok for you.
Are you OK for this ?

It's worth noting that if anyone was hoping for a more
bitkeeper/monotone/git-style tool, that is available in the form of
SVK (http://svk.elixus.org).

Disconnected operation, local repositories, all that.  But it is a
normal Subversion client as far as the server and other SVN users
are concerned.

So, everybody wins.

Subject: Translation project is alive, French is up
Message-ID: <43829344.5070807@poignantguide.net>

Frederick Ros has mentioned his work on the French translation.  And, 
also, he's done work to restructure the book to make it easy for 
translators to contribute.  His work is really paying off, I am indebted 
to him.

The current state of his French translation is up at:
   http://fr.poignantguide.net/

== How to Start a Translation ==

If you'd like to pitch in, here's how:

1. Check out the (Poignant) Guide from the repository.  (You must have 
Subversion[1] installed.)

   svn co http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/svn/poignant/trunk poignant
   cd poignant

2. The English translation is in the `lang-en' directory.  The French 
translation is in the `lang-fr' directory.  Each of these directories 
contains two files:

   poignant.yml: The complete text of the book, stored in YAML[2].
   localization.rb: A few language-specific settings
     (such as character encodings.)

3. If you'd like to start a new translation, add a new directory next to 
the English and French directories.  For example, a German translation 
based on the original English would go like this:

   cp -r lang-en lang-de
   svn add lang-de

You should use the ISO 639-1 code for your language. [3]  If there is no 
639-1 code, use the 639-2 one.

4. Once you are done editing, check in your work.  If you've never 
checked into my repository before, get an account at:
   http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/

You will need to use your Rubyforge account.  If you don't have one, 
hit: http://rubyforge.org/.

Check in your work by running `svn commit' inside the top `poignant' folder.

5. After an hour or so, you should see your work published to the draft 
domain for your language.  Using German as the example again:
   http://de-draft.poignantguide.net/

Please save your work frequently, even mid-sentence if you need.  No one 
expects the drafts to be complete or sensible at all.

6. Once you're ready to publish your changes to your language's domain, 
update the version number in your language's localization.rb file.  If 
you have just finished translating up to chapter 4, I'd suggest using 
version '0.4' as the number.

Then, let's say you get partway through chapter five.  Use '0.4.1'.

Once again, run `svn commit' and the changes will then appear at 
http://fr.poignantguide.net/.

--
Still left to be done: list the translations on the (Poignant) Guide 
cover page.  I think I'll add a bar running across the top.

As part of my work to improve the state of technical teaching, I've been 
working on an interactive Ruby tutorial.  I didn't know it was ready for 
mass consumption until the link slipped out and I scrambled to make it so.

This morning things have stablized, it's running quite nice and I 
thought you all might want to try it out:

  http://tryruby.hobix.com/

I am working on integrating this with the (Poignant) Guide.  And it will 
definitely be a part of an upcoming children's programming book I've 
been hacking on.

Please deliver bug reports to me directly.  Discussion about making this 
thing poignant belong right here on the list.

First of all, very nice work.

Second, bug reports:
.) It doesn't work with Opera 8.51 (I tested it on both WinXP and 
Linux). The console seems to fail to catch the keystrokes, since nothing 
is displayed in it, and Opera seems to catch all of them.

.) When the tutorial says 'Type your first name in quotes like this: 
"Jimmy"' and I do so, nothing happens. Only when I type 
'"Markus".reverse', I get taken to the next step of the tutorial

Other than that, I didn't have any problems.

Again, nice work.

best regards,
	Markus

truly a great piece of Ruby communism!

nice colors, even history works - it's amazing.

though the layout is nice, it lacks one thing in my eyes: a logo/mascot!
maybe you like to take http://ruby.cycnus.de/rubychan-white.png but I'm not sure 
about the copyright for this. but I could ask.

a link to ruby-lang.org would be cool.

what about translation? maybe _why wants to give it more testing before, but I 
think I find dedicated translators for German in rubyforen.de pretty easy.
just tell me and I post an article there :)

all now, Try TryRuby!
leave all books, articles, documentations, online helps behind and do the

Yes, thankyou.  I have a few features I'm hackin on right now
