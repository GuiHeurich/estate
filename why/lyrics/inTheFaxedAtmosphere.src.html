<h1>In the Faxed Atmosphere lyrics</h1>

<p>Some lyrics are slightly inaudible. I've put some words into <span class="lyrics_unsure">a light grey</span> to show which ones I wasn't sure about. If you have any corrections to these, please <a href="mailto:jeremy.ruten@gmail.com">send me mail</a>.</p>

<h3>Through the Middle of Tree</h3>

<p>Shooting through the middle of a tree<br />
I didn't think a tree could drink me<br />
The water is pushing me higher<br />
Every little gasp of light I can get<br />
I get it<br />
I don't blink my <span class="lyrics_unsure">eyes</span><br />
I'm growing into a tree<br />
I'm growing into the leaves<br />
The roots and the vines are encircling entwining<br />
I can taste all that tree</p>

<p>We're all plugged in sockets<br />
Not sockets but branches<br />
We cruise through the rooftops<br />
Of all of Chicago and Brooklyn and Spain<br />
Brooklyn and Spain go away<br />
Swiftly I feel you<br />
That breeze from your lips<br />
All of your breaths sways through the wind<br />
Leaves in my arms</p>

<h3>Micha in the Faxed Atmosphere</h3>

<p>Me and my cat we took the elevator<br />
The sky it grew upon our wide eyes<br />
But it went black and twinkled<br />
So we skipped over our boards<br />
On the stacks of faxed atmosphere<br />
<span class="lyrics_unsure">He done wasn't</span> and took a <span class="lyrics_unsure">puzzle</span> wrapper<br />
Three whole days<br />
But there wasn't any light so nobody's counting!<br />
<span class="lyrics_unsure">Tom C. Yockey I wanna be a toll</span><br />
<span class="lyrics_unsure">Why not</span> run away <span class="lyrics_unsure">with some ease all dee</span><br />
Hey-ya little kitty I want to draw</p>

<p>We scanned four planets<br />
And found the clay villages<br />
And fell into a horizontal rain<br />
We fought the brutal branch<br />
And the N-O-E-A-A-R<br />
But they got stuck in the <span class="lyrics_unsure">atmostache</span><br />
And the cats got thrown<br />
<span class="lyrics_unsure">Can kitty connection out!</span><br />
<span class="lyrics_unsure">Tom C. Yockey I wanna be a toll</span><br />
<span class="lyrics_unsure">Why not</span> run away <span class="lyrics_unsure">with some ease all dee</span><br />
Hey-ya little kitty I want to draw<br />
To draw<br />
To draw<br />
To</p>

<p><span class="lyrics_unsure">Don't know you tell me that you love me<br />
You don't know you tell me that you love me<br />
You want ten<br />
You want ten<br />
Call me lady<br />
You want ten<br />
[Starts screaming]</span></p>

<h3>Arm in the Foam</h3>

<p>On the other side of Mars<br />
I stuck an arm in the foam<br />
And I found a latch<br />
So I snapped it back<br />
Warm <span class="lyrics_unsure">fleshy</span> fluids pushed me away<br />
From the powdery surface<br />
Over which I was hovering<br />
It spilled backwards<br />
Into glowing stars<br />
And the dead universe<br />
So full around</p>

<p>I can't believe how much beauty is in here<br />
I can't believe how much beauty<br />
I can't believe</p>

<p><span class="lyrics_unsure">Bright</span> sky out there<br />
And the breathing hole<br />
Breathing through a hole<br />
<span class="lyrics_unsure">Wide you're</span> an ocean<br />
You're an unplugged cork<br />
For my arm in the foam</p>

<p>I can't believe how much beauty is in here<br />
I can't believe how much beauty<br />
I can't believe</p>

<p>My body is disintegrating <span class="lyrics_parenthetical">(8x)</span></p>

<h3>We Were Alone</h3>

<p>I crawled out from the dampness<br />
The <span class="lyrics_unsure">grey</span> swung down from the branches<br />
The smoke from the dragons remained<br />
They left us alone in the mushroom field<br />
I drew cautiously closer on her cheeks<br />
<span class="lyrics_unsure">And small nose were black dash</span><br />
Distant train burst through the billowing sound<br />
It racked us both<br />
And we lurched away!</p>

<p>But oh<br />
We were alone<br />
Such a terrible drone and swaying<br />
But oh<br />
We were alone<br />
So far from the throne<br />
We'd lost that day</p>

<p>The fires were spreading<br />
<span class="lyrics_unsure">[inaudible]</span><br />
I ran<br />
She grabbed my hand<br />
Her long hair flying<br />
Oh<br />
Our feet knocking over the rockbed<br />
Until we met Rails<br />
Oh the rails<br />
The shimmering rails<br />
The engines<br />
Rumbling all around the woods<br />
With cargo and passengers<br />
<span class="lyrics_unsure">Gloss</span> windows and horse's eyes</p>

<p>But oh<br />
We were alone<br />
And lost in the forest of trains <span class="lyrics_unsure">some day</span><br />
But oh<br />
We were alone<br />
And lost in the forest of trains<br />
Holding each other's hands</p>

<h3>You Ruined My Baby</h3>

<p>You ruined my baby<br />
You ruined my show<br />
<span class="lyrics_parenthetical">(2x)</span></p>

<p>And I never heard the sound<br />
From a hundred miles around<br />
<span class="lyrics_parenthetical">(2x)</span></p>

<p>You ruined my baby<br />
You ruined my show<br />
<span class="lyrics_parenthetical">(2x)</span></p>

<p>Oh ho<br />
I uh<br />
And I never heard the sound<br />
And I know<br />
From a hundred miles around<br />
Oh and I know<br />
That you'd never heard the sound<br />
Oh ho<br />
Oh ho<br />
From a hundred miles around<br />
Around<br />
Round...</p>

<h3>Knees High Arms Low</h3>

<p>Knees high<br />
Arms low<br />
Knees high<br />
Arms</p>

<p>Knees high and arms low<br />
We're gonna take it downstairs for a while<br />
Knees high and arms low<br />
We're gonna hang upside down</p>

<p>This long fuse will suit me fine<br />
Burn it all down the door disintegrates<br />
This long fuse will suit me fine<br />
Burn it all down the wall caves in</p>

<p>Since my love drifts away<br />
I stay awake all night and sweat<br />
Since my love drifts away<br />
I've forgotten the things<br />
Ya told me on another day<br />
Since my</p>

<p><span class="lyrics_parenthetical">(Repeat all)</span></p>

<p>Since my<br />
Since my<br />
Love<br />
Drifts away</p>

<h3>Ormus</h3>

<p>Ormus the canary<br />
Born a single atom<br />
His parents did not see him<br />
He swam in my eye</p>

<p>I'd open up my face but not today<br />
I'd open up my face but not today<br />
I'd open up my face<br />
I'd open up my face</p>

<p><span class="lyrics_unsure">Barn glaff the air pore</span><br />
In a big safe summer light<br />
Quiet all night<br />
Hidden behind my smile</p>

<p>I'd open up my face but not today <span class="lyrics_parenthetical">(6x)</span><br />
I'd open up my face<br />
I'd open up my face</p>

<h3>How I Adore the Runaway</h3>

<p>How I adore the runaway in stride<br />
Each syncopated foot<br />
Alone with their own<br />
Leaving the sorrowful places<br />
One by one by one by one<br />
They have trodden the concrete alone<br />
Preparing the checklist<br />
For there is but one item<br />
Themselves<br />
How efficient and trim<br />
Go go<br />
Go go go go go go go go go go</p>

<p>But oh here comes the dead love<br />
Here comes the dead love<br />
But oh here comes the dead love<br />
Here comes the dead love</p>

<p>Run not<br />
Be weary<br />
But fidget<br />
Be calm and collected<br />
But with a nervous jiggling eye</p>

<p>Don't go it feels slow on the outside <span class="lyrics_parenthetical">(6x)</span></p>

<p>Eventually they almost stop<br />
According to the laws<br />
Of stopping and slowing down<br />
And the principles of sleeping<br />
Are even completely forgetting<br />
Some runaways<br />
Forget it all</p>

<p>But oh let the heart grip itself<br />
Make it its own<br />
Let it freeze<br />
Its love<br />
Was greater than people deserved</p>

<p>One two three four</p>

<h3>Driving On the TV</h3>

<p>Yah<br />
It's the perfect day<br />
In a dream<br />
With the screen<br />
Bordering everything<br />
Nobody's in the window<br />
Nobody's in the house<br />
No sky no weather<br />
Nothing's underground</p>

<p>Cause we're driving on the TV<br />
Driving on the TV<br />
We're driving on the TV<br />
Driving on the TV<br />
With you<br />
Singing to me<br />
On the radio</p>

<h3>Making Sense</h3>

<p>I've lost the reasons<br />
In the pieces<br />
Of our existence<br />
Cause the bridge to me is broken<br />
And the field is full of <span class="lyrics_unsure">fide</span></p>

<p>Living has become a way of making sense<br />
Living has simply become a way of making sense</p>

<p><span class="lyrics_unsure">Tractors shift in the park<br />
On teeth in the dark</span><br />
Follow dim projections<br />
Spires blocks buildings spread wide<br />
City levels <span class="lyrics_unsure">drop tides</span><br />
Leaving dimpled reflections</p>

<p>You have enticed arrows<br />
And sheltered tethers<br />
A brimming very true recognition of all we have<br />
And I know that I belong to you<br />
And I see all of your pretty <span class="lyrics_unsure">coo</span></p>

<p>But living has become a way of making sense<br />
Living has simply become a way of making sense</p>

<p><span class="lyrics_unsure">Tractors shift in the park<br />
On teeth in the dark</span><br />
Follow dim projections<br />
Spires blocks buildings spread wide<br />
City levels <span class="lyrics_unsure">drop tides</span><br />
Leaving dimpled reflections</p>

<p>That's the man on the coast<br />
That's the one she loved most<br />
That's the one mother wanted<br />
Shaking hands with the transparent millionaires<br />
The decadence grows<br />
As the <span class="lyrics_unsure">hour hellos</span></p>

<h3>You Came to Stay</h3>

<p>You came<br />
To stay with me<br />
Cause you were running away<br />
All night and all day</p>

<p>And all night<br />
You looked the other way<br />
As I made you a bed<br />
And turned out the lights</p>

<p>What would talking have done anyway<br />
Not with your <span class="lyrics_unsure">eyes</span> were so clear<br />
What would talking have done anyway<br />
We turned off the lights in the hall</p>

<p>And I slept on my side<br />
And in the morning I felt your shape<br />
Your arms reaching around<br />
Your nose on my spine</p>

<p>We curled like a paperclip</p>

<h3>Seeking Clou Shrimp On the Shortwave</h3>

<p>I started picking flowers in the wrong side today<br />
Got transmission on my headset<br />
Who finally started running toward the sunset<br />
With my whiskers blowing<br />
I climbed the trellis<br />
That wound up the station<br />
<span class="lyrics_unsure">Taryn</span> swung the dish around<br />
And the feedback<br />
Knocked me off the tower's broad edge</p>

<p>I clapped my paws upon my ears<br />
(I scampered in the dead air)<br />
The static poured right through my audio processes<br />
(They're camping in the dead air)<br />
That's how my brain got locked on radio shock<br />
(I scampered in the dead air)<br />
That's how my brain got locked on radio shock<br />
(They're camping in the dead air)<br />
That's how the silence filled my ears<br />
That's how the static filled my ears</p>

<p>The polygrip on my gloves<br />
Wouldn't catch on the smooth sheer walls<br />
Of the intervening canyons<br />
Antennas yeah (wooh wooh!)<br />
The billowing tents below<br />
Held the concentrate<br />
<span class="lyrics_unsure">In the</span> shortwave cats<br />
That littered the airwaves<br />
With rats, clou shrimp, <span class="lyrics_unsure">tame</span> piranha</p>

<p>I clapped my paws upon my ears<br />
(I scampered in the dead air)<br />
The static poured right through my audio processes<br />
(They're camping in the dead air)<br />
That's how my brain got locked on radio shock<br />
(I scampered in the dead air)<br />
That's how my brain got locked on radio shock</p>

<p>They're camping in the dead air<br />
I scampered in the dead air<br />
They're camping in the dead air</p>

<p>The silence filled my ears<br />
The static filled my ears<br />
<span class="lyrics_parenthetical">(3x)</span></p>

<p>The silence filled my ears<br />
That's how the static filled my ears</p>
