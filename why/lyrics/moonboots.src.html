<h3>microcosmic</h3>

<p>Everybody wants to be a little star in the sky<br />
Microcosmic and a speck that (...)</p>

<h3>in this room</h3>

<h3>astronaut at sea</h3>

<p>In dreams of you<br />
I fell to earth<br />
In dreams of you<br />
I fell to earth</p>

<p>In dreams of you<br />
I fell</p>

<p>American girl<br />
Send me out to sea<br />
Where the waves rumble<br />
And the soul is free<br />
I once was found<br />
And now I'm lost<br />
Out in the blue<br />
Where lost love's tossed<br />
But it ain't like Hemingway<br />
I never liked him anyway<br />
And I would've died for certain<br />
And they were just about to close the big curtain<br />
But just on the sun-bred skyline<br />
I saw there the most saintly eyes<br />
In all the heavens that I call home<br />
In all the heavens I am alone<br />
In all the heavens that I call home<br />
American girl I am alone<br />
Where the waves rumble<br />
And the soul is free<br />
American girl<br />
Send me out to sea</p>

<p>It's been a long time<br />
Too long to count<br />
So put me on a ship<br />
And send me on home<br />
Space is so large<br />
Too large for my heart<br />
So put me on a boat<br />
And take me all the way home<br />
The sea is so deep<br />
Too deep for me<br />
Well put me on a ship<br />
And bring me back home</p>

<h3>he hates me, she hates me</h3>

<p>I've hoped for something more<br />
But somehow I got short<br />
Love is a game we play<br />
Until you have to pay</p>

<p>Love more come to me<br />
I will not believe<br />
That she cares for me<br />
There's too much she will never see</p>

<p>It's all so innocent<br />
Till one of us gets hurt<br />
Loneliness can't compete<br />
Till one of us will surely cheat<br />
[KABOOM]<br />
Cheat<br />
Cheat</p>

<h3>the fish said hello</h3>

<p>(...)<br />
Stop telling me<br />
Your heart is still<br />
Beating strong<br />
I fell off the bridge<br />
An angel pushed me<br />
The water was warm<br />
And the fish said hello<br />
My mind filled<br />
With the water<br />
I saw an old coral<br />
Perfect stop sign<br />
And a treasure chest<br />
It was empty<br />
So I got in it<br />
I shut the lid<br />
And it invited in the sand<br />
But the sand hurt my eyes<br />
And it was no surprise<br />
Since I was just<br />
Thirty seconds away<br />
From my fate</p>

<h3>no response, shoo fly</h3>

<p>Beautiful day<br />
Perfect sky<br />
All around me<br />
All around</p>

<p>Beautiful night<br />
Starry sky<br />
All around me<br />
Big surprise</p>

<p>I am calling for my friend<br />
I cannot hear a response</p>

<p>Winter sights<br />
Sparkling white<br />
Everywhere<br />
Krys' nearby</p>

<p>Silhouettes<br />
Pale and ghostly<br />
Dancing around<br />
Might need your light</p>

<p>I am calling for my friend<br />
I cannot hear a response</p>

<p>Morning awakes<br />
Dock the dreams<br />
Finally awake<br />
Into the sun</p>

<p>Looking around<br />
I'm not alone<br />
Lucky day<br />
Happy day</p>

<p>I'm not calling for my friend<br />
I can now hear a response</p>

<p>Shoo flies<br />
Flying higher than the stars<br />
On a foggy night</p>

<p>Catch them all<br />
Hold them in your hands<br />
Throw them in the past</p>

<p>Running high<br />
Always catching a ride</p>

<p>This is the future<br />
And what happens do I cry</p>

<h3>bony legs that talk</h3>

<p>I am not crippled<br />
I've got bony legs that talk<br />
They walk through blue-grey streets<br />
Perform great feats<br />
And abide every pratfall</p>

<p>And these lungs bruise just like a thousand shoes do<br />
It's true we breathe apologies to please them all</p>

<p>What lies in store<br />
A meteor a falling star<br />
That's circular<br />
And in the end is similar</p>

<p>I am not crippled<br />
I've got bony legs that talk<br />
They walk through blue-grey streets<br />
Perform great feats<br />
And abide every pratfall</p>

<h3>last day of may</h3>

<p>It was the last day of may in ninety-eight<br />
And you accompanied me to</p>

<p>We had been something like friends</p>

<p>We had a few hits and misses<br />
Mostly misses</p>

<p>When I thought it was the last chance I'd ever have<br />
I finally kissed you</p>

<p>(...)<br />
There was something<br />
Like heaven and hell</p>

<p>One of them's still in you<br />
You told me that you loved me</p>

<p>I didn't believe you then<br />
I still don't<br />
Wish I could<br />
I wish I could</p>

<p>I never meant to break your heart<br />
Didn't want to break your heart</p>

<p>I know you cared for me<br />
And I wish I could've felt the same<br />
Wish I could've felt the same</p>

<p>Maybe some day I'll understand it all myself<br />
But until then<br />
I hope the words "I'm sorry"<br />
Can finally carry conviction</p>

<h3>i feel</h3>

<p>I feel<br />
I<br />
I<br />

<h3>elfin princess</h3>

<p>Golden bow<br />
And silver hair<br />
And she won't find<br />
The sun in there</p>

<p>Clad in greens<br />
And plates of mail<br />
She fights with string<br />
But she's in hell</p>

<p>Darkness comes<br />
She's all alone<br />
Her magic's gone<br />
Where will she go</p>

<p>Up to the clouds<br />
And feathers strong</p>

<h3>christopher robin</h3>

<p>Christopher Robin<br />
Came to my room<br />
He had a message<br />
Bout that night in June</p>

<p>He spoke of Mary<br />
And how she died<br />
He was to say<br />
There was no surprise</p>

<p>She killed herself<br />
With a broken knife</p>

<h3>il fiore</h3>

Il fiore<br />
Il fiore</p>

<h3>fireflies</h3>

Glowing<br />
