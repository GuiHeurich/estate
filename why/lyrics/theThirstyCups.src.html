and a french braid i dipped in marmalade<br />

if i can just get my act together and draw some wizards</p>

<p>this book is made from smoke and mayonnaise<br />
and tripping over my mouse cord while i scanned on saturdays<br />

<p>this book was made<br />
while violins were playing<br />
this book was made<br />
of syrup stains and cupboard oil</p>

<p>this book was born from elaborate pain<br />
i felt while drawing mazes</p>

<p>this book is made<br />
of elephants that were praying<br />
and thrown in a junkyard and smashed</p>

<p>this book is made<br />
of pharmacist gangs<br />
that fight with those knives they use to separate pills<br />
and i'm gonna take over the pharmacies when they're gone</p>

<p>this book is made<br />
of parachutes in a video game</p>

<p>and when you press "a"<br />
the parachute goes up<br />
and when you press "b"<br />
the parachute turns green</p>

<p>and the parachute<br />
turns green</p>

<p>it fades into<br />
green<br />
skies</p>

<p>introducing the magic elf<br />
(...)<br />

<p>oh<br />
oh yes<br />
hello<br />
welcome<br />
one and all<br />
to the underground labs<br />
of animal perfect<br />
the most perfect animal labs<br />
in the world<br />
ha ha ha ha</p>

<p>come<br />
let us descend<br />
into the darkness<br />
of ambrose caverns</p>

<p>(...)<br />
to build an animal<br />
yeah<br />
where did your cat go<br />
cause i'll tell you where mine went<br />
down to ambrose caves</p>

<p>cause where did your cat go<br />
cause i'll tell you where mine went<br />
down to ambrose caves</p>

<p>all aboard now<br />
leaving the trains and buses and ambrose caverns<br />
what a sight to see all the animals and pets<br />
that have poised around this young elf lo these many years<br />
during the structuring of the monetary paradigm<br />
and the insistence of perfection upon these animals<br />
desperate times i say<br />
desperate times</p>

<p>there goes the sad pelican<br />
likely the last of his pelican instincts<br />
how he wants to be<br />
get this elf ... raving mad<br />
how he wants to be<br />
and he is still here with us<br />
he can't help but think that he isn't even in control of this<br />
oh he defiled ham<br />
he carries with him an elephant man</p>

<h3>chap 5 - belljar + space + my daughter's organ instructor</h3>

<p>ba da<br />
on my own<br />
in a bell jar</p>

<p>space<br />
he got shot into big space<br />
holding onto his chair<br />
as he rammed through the atmosphere<br />
flying all the way<br />
out into space<br />
and that guy he got good space<br />
well he landed on<br />
a distant star and he<br />
lived all the way<br />
space<br />
he went so far away<br />
he crash landed on a barren desert<br />
and looked around in the morning<br />
and apple blossoms were flowing around<br />
the castle was shimmering so very far<br />
and as he climbed up inside<br />
as he crawled through the castle<br />
he was practically blind<br />
he met a little goat<br />
who collected video tapes<br />
la</p>

<p>my daughter's organ instructor<br />
i met him in the back of a cold cold museum<br />
he's a regular fellow from the planet endertromb</p>

<p>and he's got this mumbling ... sentences<br />
parenthetical phrases lifted through his breaths<br />
... pon-shoo pon-shoo em-pithy-dah<br />
and the elephant snored in reply</p>

<p>oh paij-ree<br />
turns out i can't call you that in the evening<br />
oh paij-ree<br />
tell me again that story bout the wash out house<br />
and the bird named<br />
e flat f f a</p>

<p>mean mister mulligan's next door neighbour<br />
he tossed a mossy chair through paij-ree's forward window<br />
and paij-ree a young lad thought it was his dad<br />
and i'll ask you to forgive him he's a long way from home</p>

<p>let's just say that my daughter is born in twenty twelve sixteen<br />
somewhere in that range<br />
i trust her little fingers to this ovalish man<br />
i hope he'll teach her the pneumatic harpsichord<br />
or the hammond organ colonnade<br />
with a leslie cs13 tube speaker<br />
or maybe even a gulbransen pacemaker<br />
i don't care<br />
whatever it be<br />
it be<br />
it be<br />
it be</p>

<h3>chap 6 - downtown + dwemthy</h3>

<p>the rabbit is coming to slay dwemthy's array<br />
in dwemthy's array</p>

<p>(...)</p>

<p>the dragon is here<br />
he's going to slay<br />
the rabbit<br />
in dwemthy's array</p>

<p>you think it's a play<br />
but that is ..ay<br />
the rabbit and dragon<br />
fighting in dwemthy's array</p>

<p>in dwemthy's array</p>

<h3>chap 7 - wish upon a beard</h3>

<p>believe it or not<br />
when i wished upon a star<br />
it came down close<br />
and sat on my arm<br />
oh-wow-o-wow-o-wow-o-wow-o-wow-o-wow-ow<br />
oh-wow-o-wow-o-wow-o-wow-o-wow-o-wow-ow</p>

<p>i reached my hands out and grabbed this goated thing<br />
off the fee and tickled my chin<br />
it was thick and rich<br />
a ... beard<br />
i wore it on my chin<br />
and never feared<br />
whether i'd stay alive<br />
or whether i'd die<br />
i was rich and i was gainfully employed<br />
i mystified the press<br />
and they mistook me for a man<br />
mark twain to be exact<br />
but i really was a ca-ca-ca-ca-ca-cat</p>

<h3>chap 8 - the heavens harp</h3>

<p>you put the wheel on the wall<br />
you put the wheel on the wall<br />
you put the wheel on the wall<br />
i thank you</p>
