<h2>Quotes</h2>
<h3>from Ashley Raymond</h3>
<h4>A Gifted Thinker, Architect of Preeventualism</h4>

<hr />

<h2>On Himself</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>"I know there are those out there who say I am a pseudointellectual because I have no formal education, only went to choral school, and because I deprived myself of acorns... The list goes on.</p>
    <p>"But I am sure that if these fine men and women were preeventualists, it would be a completely different story."</p>
    <p>&#0151; <i>Ashley Raymond, Georgia Tech University, 1983</i></p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2>On the Rise of Preeventualism</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>"If preeventualism ever kills mainstream culture, that would be truly apocalyptic.  Anyway, I'll let other visionaries speculate on that possibility.  It's against my ideals to venture down that road any further.</p>
    <p>&#0151; <i>Ashley Raymond, "The Old Man and His Helmet," Arch Quarterly, p. 86</i></p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2>On the Future</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>"Preeventualism is <u>not</u> about rejecting the future.  No, how could that be? ... I don't reject the many great or abominable things which may happen in the future.</p>
    <p>"I just reject the concepts and beliefs man is relying upon to get there!"</p>
    <p>&#0151; <i>Ashley Raymond, <u>A History of Life and Charcoal Briquets</u>, p. 421</i></p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2>On Socialism</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"I stopped paying attention to socialism a long time ago.  My socialist friends won't leave me alone, though.  They say, it's only a hop-skip away from preeventualism!</p>
<p>"Ha!  These people and their ideologies!"</p>
<p>&#0151; <i>Ashley Raymond, "Audio Reviews on Teolite.org", 2001</i></p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2>On Education</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>"I'm going to avoid making sweeping accusations about the state of education in the world.  Except to say that I find it all entirely revolting.  Face it.  None of my teachers ever came to grips with what a slow reader I am."</p>
    <p>&#0151; <i>Ashley Raymond, Georgia Tech University, 1983</i></p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2>On Correctness</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>"A student asked me, 'Mr. Raymond, is preeventualism complete?  Have you finished it?  What if the current incarnation of preeventualism is proven to be incorrect?'</p>
    <p>"The other students shook their heads.  I believe the moderator of the discussion even said, 'Good question.'</p>
    <p>"I stormed toward the student and yelled, 'That is the most ridiculous question I've ever heard!  The fundamental precept of preeventualism is that it is correct!  At any cost: it is correct!  Preeventualism has abandoned all other concepts in favor of correctness!  What more do you need?'
    <p>"And that student vomited."</p>
    <p>&#0151; <i>Ashley Raymond, Georgia Tech University, 1983</i></p>
