<h2>The Tenants of Preeventualism</h2>

<ol>
<li><i>Eventualism</i> is a general term for any currently nonexistent
    philosophy which presumes to explain how current trends will lead to
    a certain future.  Most preeventualists are oblivious to the specifics
    of such theories and choose to ignore manifestations of eventualism
    in any form.</li>
<li><i>Pre</i>eventualism anticipates these ideas and theories which are
constantly on the verge of realization.  Therefore, Preeventualism is always on the
    forefront of culture.  Preeventualists never engage in dated or
    impractical philosophies since preeventualism moves on to anticipating
    new philosophies after one has come into play.</li>
<li><i>Optimism</i> is engendered by eventualists.  They regard their
    ideals with hope that these ideals will materialize.  Even dark, dystopian
    vantage points cling to a vision of the future that <i>eventually</i>
    will be realized.  Preeventualists embody frustration with society
    and all its various forms of thinking.  They have been disenfranchised by a world
    which insists upon failing to live up to futuristic claims of superior modes
    of thinking.</li>

<p>At this point, many students wonder if preeventualism is merely the antithesis to hope.  It is not.  Ashley Raymond has referred to such thinking as "posteventualism, if such a thing were worth believing."</p>

<p>On the contrary, preeventualism is founded on the understanding that hope will always prevail in any mode of thinking.  The preeventualist simply opts for a primitive philosophy, wherein concepts are abstract and ideas have not grown to a point where hope can be inspired.</p>

<p>Which is why many have referred to preeventualism as <i>surintellectualism</i>.</p>
