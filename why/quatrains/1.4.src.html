<h1>1.4</h1>

<p>Your eyes are blue chalk crosses<br />In runny black pen puddles<br />And a beetle crawls in the drops<br />Making no progress in any direction.</p>

<p>Your face is fragile polished wood,<br />So expensive, from way out in the countryside,<br />They made an airplane out of it<br />And it flew behind everything that can be seen.</p>
