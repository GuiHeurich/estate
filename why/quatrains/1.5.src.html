<p>Clearly, you and I should be up there.<br />We should be the hosts of this banquet.<br />I'd press the elevator button for people<br />And clean the crab legs and you'd help me.</p>

<p>I'll bet the staff just lives upstairs,<br />Heck, all we'd need is a bunk bed.<br />I could pick out what the waitresses wear and,<br />After that, I'd come find you and take a break.</p>
