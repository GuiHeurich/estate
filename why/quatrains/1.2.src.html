<h1>1.2</h1>

<p>You're all shaken cats<br />In the shadowy lane,<br />Tearing ears from the scowling men<br />For currency and for the young.</p>

<p>I ask Elmy to slow the car,<br />Let the tails wipe it.<br />And the lower we sink into our seats,<br />The more rabbits we draw and the deeper we draw them.</p>
