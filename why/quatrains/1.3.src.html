<h1>1.3</h1>

<p>That cadillac of yours and that driver of yours!<br />You and your teacups rattling away in the back seat!<br />You always took the mike, oh, and all those cowboys you shot!<br />I held your hand! And I'll shoot a cowboy one day!</p>

<p>You said, "Let's run into the woods like kids!"<br />You said, "Let's rub our hands together super-hot!"<br />And we scalded the trees and left octagons, I think that was you and<br />You threw parties on the roof!</p>
