<h1>Eagle (a Five-Minute Play for Twins Who Don't Have Their Other Twin With Them and An Unlimited Supply of Animals)</h1>

<p>(A red backdrop with eagle suspended on a wire, flush left, wings spread majestically.)</p>

<p><strong>Twin</strong>: (materializing on eagle's back with Star Trek transporter FX) Everyone, sing a middle C.</p>

<p>(Audience sings a middle C, as eagle and twin are raised out of sight for three-and-a-third minutes. Blue backdrop appears.)</p>

<p><strong>Narrator</strong>: A train arrives in Hamburg. (Loudly w. trumpets.) Crash!</p>

<p>(The number 37 flashes on the screen. An audience member happens to stand up and take a photo of it at just the right instant.)</p>

<p><strong>Twin</strong>: (clapping, lowered down on a wire, eagle as well) Bravo! Now, a high E! Everyone!</p>

<p>(Audience hums or ohhhs a high E for fifty seconds. A gunshot is heard and a man falls from a tall balcony in the theatre. He lands in a tub of water placed below.)</p>

<p><strong>Twin</strong>: And now...</p>

<p>(The man in the tub of water rises to the surface and reclines naturally.)</p>

<p><strong>Twin</strong>: It looks as if he is merely bathing!</p>

<p>(A conductor appears and spreads his arms fully and, with a roll of the baton, sixteen seconds later, leads the crowd in finishing the note.)</p>
