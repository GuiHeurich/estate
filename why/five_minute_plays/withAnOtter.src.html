<h1>Otter (a Five-Minute Play for Twins Who Don't Have Their Other Twin With Them and An Unlimited Supply of Animals)</h1>

<p>(An otter enters the room. Twin is standing there. The otter holds a jar of jelly.)</p>

<p><strong>Otter</strong>: (slowly) We're out of jelly.</p>

<p><strong>Twin</strong>: THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE!!</p>

<p>(Twin proceeds to ransack the room for remaining four-and-five-sixths minutes.)</p>
