<h1>Octopus (a Five-Minute Play for Twins Who Don't Have Their Other Twin With Them and An Unlimited Supply of Animals)</h1>

<p>(An octopus is busy chaining together air conditioners and, from the audience's perspective, he has piled air conditioners upwards, an endless tower which ascends right up into the zenith. A toy gun and an imaginary van lay in disarray on the floor to establish setting: a child's playroom.)</p>

<p><strong>Twin</strong>: (entering the room) Mother just said you need to stop.</p>

<p><strong>Octopus</strong>: What about your wall clock? Did you notice that the hands on your wall clock are beginning to turn <em>against</em> time?</p>

<p>(Twin thoughtfully observes the wall clock, which is situated off-stage.)</p>

<p><strong>Twin</strong>: Almost as if...</p>

<p>(Twin's voice trails off, his eyes transfixed. The moment intensifies for two minutes and a quarter. The octopus takes the opportunity to continue stacking air conditioners.)</p>

<p><strong>Twin</strong>: (in outburst) Hexospantaneous machinations! Thinking for itselves!</p>

<p><strong>Octopus</strong>: And so elementary locomotion reverses, my boy. Your wall clock is beginning to alter its movement to meet its own primitive needs. Survival, of course. Remember that time I piled baseball caps on your head, in an endless cascade, until it pressed the atmosphere outward, thus causing tremendous expansion of the air?</p>

<p><strong>Twin</strong>: Yes, I cried.</p>

<p><strong>Octopus</strong>: It was beautiful. Now, open your hand.</p>

<p><strong>Twin</strong>: Oh, I... (mumbling) hadn't noticed it was closed...</p>

<p>(Twin unfolds his fingers. A tiny, tiny bird with a clock strapped to its back flies over the audience's heads for a whole minute fifty. A tile in the ceiling opens up and a vacuum hose appears with powerful sucking which captures the bird and whisks it into the darkness.)</p>

<p>(The head of a bald man with spectacles appears from the missing tile. And, <em>X</em> is written on his crown in charcoal.)</p>

<p><strong>Bald man</strong>: We are letting the audience out early tonight.</p>

<p>(The faithful do stick around for the remaining twenty minutes in case there are any hidden scenes.)</p>
