<h1>Swan (a Five-Minute Play for Twins Who Don't Have Their Other Twin With Them and An Unlimited Supply of Animals)</h1>

<p><strong>Swan</strong>: (holding up a detached finger) Is this yours?</p>

<p><strong>Twin</strong>: No.</p>

<p><strong>Swan</strong>: Are you sure? <em>It's scorching hot.</em></p>

<p>(Twin thinks. Twin extracts a stack of 3" x 5" index cards from own pants pocket. Twin adeptly leafs through each card in the stack for three and five-quarter minutes. Twin arrives at a card and gasps.)</p>

<p><strong>Twin</strong>: It's not a finger after all! It's a swan from Saturn! <em>That's what they look like.</em></p>

<p><strong>Swan</strong>: <em>A swan? Can it be?</em> I have waited my whole life to fall in love. But... why is it so hot?</p>

<p>(Twin wonders. Twin resumes flipping through his stack of index cards. For one-half minutes. Upon encountering the final card, Twin once again exhibits great shock and bewilderment.)</p>

<p><strong>Twin</strong>: Our Saturnian swan is not hot in the least! It's applauding! That is part of its peculiar nature.</p>

<p><strong>Swan</strong>: And you're <em>sure</em> it's not just a dismembered finger which has, until now, been basking in extreme sunlight?</p>

<p>(Twin tucks the deck of cards back into his pocket. The swan--along with any audience members seated nearest the actors--immediately notes the embroidered letters on Twin's pocket which read: <em>Interstellar Swan Knowledge Banks (A Temporary Housing Facility).</em>)</p>

<p><strong>Twin</strong>: You see, the rest of Dr. Starr's assets are tied up in probate.</p>

<p><strong>Swan</strong>: What luck.</p>
