<h1>The Little Coder's Predicament</h1>
            
<p>Okay, then, children of the modern age (where we live in a world so tied together with wires that Pangaea ain't goin' nowhere!), you tell me if this is a predicament or not.</p>

<p>In the 1980s, you could look up from your <a href="http://www.lemon64.com/">Commodore 64</a>,  hours after purchasing it,  with a glossy feeling of empowerment, achieved by the pattern of notes spewing from the  speaker grille in an endless loop. You were part of the movement to help machines sing!  You were a programmer! The <a href="http://kl.net/atari/">Atari 800</a> people had <span class="caps">BASIC</span>.   They know what I'm talking about.   And the <a href="http://www.guidry.org/ti994a/systempics/4asystem-2.jpg">TI-994A</a>  guys don't need to say a word, because the TI could   <a href="http://www.obsoletecomputermuseum.org/ti99/ti99_syn.jpg">say it</a> for them!</p>

<p>The old machines don't compare to the desktops of today, or to the consoles of today.   But, sadly, current versions of Windows have no immediately accessible programming languages.   And what's a kid going to do with Visual Basic? Build a modal dialog? Forget coding for XBox.  Requires registration in the XBox Developer Program. Otherwise, you gotta crack the sucker  open. GameCube? GameBoy? Playstation 2?</p>

<h2>Coding Just Isn't Accessible</h2>

<p>Yes, there are burgeoning <a href="http://openxdk.sourceforge.net/">free</a> <a href="http://gbdk.sourceforge.net/">SDKs</a>  for many of these platforms. But they are obscure   and most children have no means of actually deploying or executing the code on their own  hardware! This is obvious to us all and likely doesn't seem such a big deal. But ask yourself  what might have happened had you not had access to a programming language on an Atari 800 or  a Commodore. You tell me if this is a predicament.</p>

<p>It turns out, most of the kids in my neighborhood are exposed to coding through the   <a href="http://www.ticalc.org/">TI calculator</a>.  A handful of <a href="http://www.ticalc.org/programming/columns/">languages</a>  are available on the TI and its processor is interesting enough to  evoke some curiousity. But this hasn't spread to its <span class="caps">PDA</span> big brothers, where young people  could have more exposure to programming. And undoubtedly the utility of a language on the Palm,  Pocket PC and others would be useful to many.</p>

<p>So what's the problem here? We have no shortage of new languages, but they become  increasingly distanced from the populace. Are the companies behind these platforms   weary of placing the power of a programming language in the hands of users?   Is there not a demand any longer? It's got to be some kind of greed, power, money thing,  right?</p>

<p>Perhaps this is just another reason to push Linux and <span class="caps">BSD</span> on  consumer systems. Still, are scripting languages easily accessible to   beginners on those systems? <span class="caps">OSX</span> has made several scripting languages available  (including Ruby and Python), but most users are unaware of their presence.</p>

<p>I should mention that Windows is equipped with its own scripting host for developing  in JScript and VBScript. But the use of the scripting host is (I believe) under-documented  and limited for beginners. Try doing something useful in a script without using  Server.CreateObject. Let's not let kids touch the <span class="caps">COM</span> objects, please!</p>

<h2>The Christmas List</h2>

<p>I'm thinking a toy language for <i>consoles and desktops alike</i> could be monumental. I'm  ot saying it needs to be cross-platform. A language for GameCube that took advantage of  platform-specific features could be more appealing to GameCube users than a language that   used a reduced featureset, but could execute on a handheld. Really, we live in a world  where both choices should be available.</p>

<p>As for essential features:</p>

<p><strong>1. Transportable code.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>On my TI-994A, I could make a little, animated Optimus Prime  from pixels. Insert cassette. Record. Pass around to friends. Receive high fives from  friends. Put on wraparound shades. Thank you, TI! Thank you, Optimus Prime!</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>A little language for the consoles could be wildly popular if combined with the good  ature of sharing code. This could be done by trading memory cards, but would be  more effective if code could be easily obtained and posted on the Web. Learning would  accelerate and collaborative development could take place.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>A suitable language should give coders access to I/O devices, to allow experimentation  with network devices and the ability to enhance one's connectivity with others. For the  consoles, games could provide hooks for user mods. This has long proven a successful  staple of the desktop gaming world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>2. Simplicity.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>You've got to be able to write a single line of code and see a result.  We need some instant results to give absolute beginners confidence. Simple methods  for sending an e-mail, reading a web page, playing music. Demonstrable in a one-liner.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Admittedly, as our systems have grown complex, it is difficult to balance simplicity and  capability. Most users will be unimpressed by code that emits beeps and bloops from a  PlayStation 2. If Ruby were available on the <span class="caps">PS2</span>, then I would hope that I could hear  rich symphonic sounds from a wee bit of code.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><code>Orchestra.play( "A:2", "C:4", "E:1", "G:1" )</code></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Access to the graphic engine might require more complex code. But simple drawing methods  could be provided for beginners. Or images could be stored alongside code and accessed  programmatically.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><code>ImageLibrary.load( "GolfingOldMan" ).drawAt( 12, 10 )</code></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>The trick would be to uncover what small applications might entice novices and still provide  the ability to write large applications that would drive developers to master the language  and not limit their growth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>3. Sensible environment.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Considering that many won't want to purchase a keyboard for their gaming unit, let's  make sure that a reasonable environment is provided for entry of text. Controllers  could be worked like the <a href="http://www.handykey.com/">Twiddler</a>. Or code could  be transferred via IR, <span class="caps">TCP</span>/IP. (Dare I say cassette? :D)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>4. Give it away!</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>It used to be that programming was practically an inalienable right for users. Include  a language with the system, situated in a friendly spot. Each of the game consoles I've  mentioned has launchers. (With the exception of Game Boy and its successors.)  Provide a development prompt from the launcher. From desktop software, provide shortcuts  for both the command prompt and a development prompt.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Remember, we're looking for a language that requires no system hacks. No obscure links.  No warranty violation. We've become so used to these techniques that it seems to be an  essential part of getting our way.</p>

<p>And in many ways it is essential. Tinkering with hardware is learning. Lobotomizing and  renovating is meaningful, magical. On behalf of those who prefer to code, I make these  wishes. Not to take away jobs from the Phillips screwdriver.</p>

<h2>The Ultimatum</h2>

<p>My challenge is to Sony, Nintendo, Microsoft, Apple, and to those who  manufacture and develop our interactive technology. Let us interact with these machines  more deeply. Provide us a channel for having a dialogue with the entertainment boxes  we nurture and care for. I swear to you, the relationship between the public and your  product will assuredly blossom. That box will become more of a chest for our personal  works.</p>

<p>In addition, if your developers start putting out crap, then you have a whole world of  people to pick up the slack.</p>

<p>My challenge is for you to bundle a useful programming language with your  product. Ruby, Squeak, <span class="caps">REBOL</span>, Python. Take your pick. It will be inexpensive to add  any of these languages to your systems. And people will seriously pray to you.  You know how geeks get when they pledge allegiance to something.  But, yes, Ruby is preferable.</p>
