<h1>The Skier</h1>

<p>One man had become such an impulsive skier that he started skiing down dirt roads in the summer. It actually wasn't such a bad sport and the guy won a silver medal when Dust Country Skiing went national.</p>
 
<p>The fashion these people wore was atrocious, though. It was common to see ski poles with leather tassles on the handles and such nonsense.</p>
