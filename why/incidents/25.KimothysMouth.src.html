<h1>Kimothy's Mouth</h1>

<p>Kimothy's mouth was a warp zone. Which meant that infrequently--gosh, let's say about as often as two archers dive into an ocean simultaneously--a pair of trousers or a coupon book or something would fly off her tongue. This even happened at church and at job interviews.</p>

<p>You should also know about one day in her history when a man dressed in radios all over ran up to her and said, "I need to deliver this Mondrian Cowl to the Dreyfrowns!" And he shoved a monkey statue in her mouth.</p>

<p>Okay, so get this. A little while later she was waiting for a friend, down in this hotel lobby. And she was looking around and she saw that same monkey statue over by the fireplace! The one for the Dreyfrowns.</p>

<p>She tucked her chin down and, very discreetly, nudged the monkey statue back into the fireplace. And, slowly, everso slowly, she let it topple out of her lips.</p>

<p>The rest of the afternoon Kimothy spent swallowing coins and watching hot nickels land on the feet of people who went to warm their hands. That is, until a guy with giraffe hands came out of her mouth and said, "Stop screwing with our warp zone!" and he slapped her a memorable number of times right on the forehead with his flattened palm.</p>
