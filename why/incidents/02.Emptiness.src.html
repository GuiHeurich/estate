<h1>Emptiness</h1>

<p>Harriet and Clover were at the mall, trying on hats. Harriet happened to put on a certain hat that was loaded to the brim with mosquitoes. A few mosquitoes got the idea to hide there and a bunch of other mosquitoes simply copied the idea. They worked quickly on Harriet, devouring her to such an extent that when Clover came over to demonstrate a skirt, Clover screamed and dropped the skirt. Harriet had been replaced by emptiness.</p>

<p>These days the universe is all about emptiness.</p>
