<h1>The Story Life Doesn't Explain</h1>

<p>Once there was another guy, same as The Life Guy: he ate heat lamps and crapped fish. But this one didn't have an ecosystem inside. This time, it was just the guy's diet.</p>

<p>He went deepsea diving with his business partner, Jamie Tartreuse. While he was down there, he saw a swordfish swimming along that had a whole giraffe carcass stuck on its nose.</p>

<p>The guy didn't panick or anything, but he did say to himself, inside his mask, "From now on, life isn't self-explanatory." That guy hit the nail on the head.</p>
