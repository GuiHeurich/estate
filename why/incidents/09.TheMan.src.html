<h1>The Man</h1>

<p>A man built an automobile entirely from carrots and was known for it in several counties. When people spoke with him, they would speak of nothing but carrots. There came a day when the man realized that he couldn't remember ever having non-carrot discussions. Fueled by an intense will to free himself from this cruel and perpetual cycle, the man set off to blaze a new trail for himself.</p>

<p>The man rented a bird costume and jumped off the roof of a hotel in town. He didn't survive the fall, which was probably best, as soon there wasn't a man nor woman on Earth that didn't drive a carrot car.</p>
