<h1>The Queen-Sized</h1>

<p>Once there was a queen-sized mattress who had back problems of her own. This went on for years.</p>

<p>Then, the movers came. The people who slept on her were moving. The movers picked up the weary mattress and a massive spinal cord fell out from the underside of the queen-sized. The movers screamed in horror, but the queen-sized felt such relief. Euphoria spread across her quilted lumps and she whispered to the movers, "Be still, my busy friends. (Though it be easier for me since my nervous system fled.)"</p>

<p>And I just want you all to know that this story is not in any way about accepting paralysis or even wishing for it. I honestly can't say it's about much at all.</p>
