<h1>The Incident</h1>

<p>A crew of news reporters was wandering the neighborhoods, looking for incidents to report. They found several to choose from and finally focused on a certain infestation of fruit flies. They were alarmed at the quality and intimacy of the footage they recorded that afternoon and found it difficult to leave the scene of the incident.</p>

<p>Taking some artistic license, the cameraman broadened the camera view to capture scenes of children who (hearing of the news crew) came to ride their bicycles and appear on the news. The cameraman continued to film one dark-haired boy and eventually followed the young man on to college at Stanford, also filming his adventures in London and the Slavic countries.</p>

<p>Some stayed and lived with the fruit flies and others evaporated at sunset.</p>
