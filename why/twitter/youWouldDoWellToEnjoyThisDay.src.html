<h1>You Would Do Well To Enjoy This Day</h1>

<p>(This is a serialized poem, 19 stanzas posted to Twitter starting on January 18th, 2008, and ending on January 22nd, 2008. Here’s how it looks with some enhanced punctuation and a few special-edition plurals. If you don’t like poetry, then I’m really sorry about this!)</p>

<blockquote> 
<p>this sky is chalk wherewith to sharpen my pool cue</p> 
</blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p>oh for the sky to be just once made of all mouths,<br /> 
from the licky crocodile kinds to those types<br /> 
which consume of the powdered donut gems</p> 
</blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p>would that the clear sky were now ff00ff,<br /> 
which is win32 transparent, the banned color,<br /> 
they said we wouldn&#8217;t choose it,<br /> 
well ff00ff on them<br /> 
and stop lauding david blaine but deny him due claps<br /> 
til he can stretch acrosst the sky and raise<br /> 
the dead disneys with mouth sucking force<br /> 
poor anna kornikova can&#8217;t send e-mail to any of us,<br /> 
everything she writes is arrested by the spam filters,<br /> 
and she is alone,<br /> 
can&#8217;t you see<br /> 
alone in the tennis courts,<br /> 
as hollow as the very balls she serves<br /> 
she must try harder, anna write your message on that ball<br /> 
and lob it to me!!</p> 
</blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p>oh no,<br /> 
look up, the sun sees us,<br /> 
dress me a dark domino igloo,<br /> 
tune to turtle trap tv,<br /> 
conspiracies and codes read by drowning anchors:<br /> 
these dogs in our lives are not dogs, yell the dutch,<br /> 
but merely enchanted whale&#8217;s flesh posing as such.<br /> 
and cold in the shoulder,<br /> 
a molded olds shook its gold and gilded motor,<br /> 
dug from a delorean purely powered by solved sudoku.<br /> 
the neighbor&#8217;s mice play filmstrips of a bird&#8217;s death,<br /> 
though a sales presentation can be queued by request,<br /> 
the terrible secrets of space</p> 
</blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p>we may recite and reset paint formulas on cassette,<br /> 
but when night closes down, we do turn to color wizards,<br /> 
for whom ff00ff is the hex<br /> 
rather than hypnotizing girls, they prefer to drink with a spoon<br /> 
instead of good night, they say good after moon<br /> 
anyhowtho, the girls will prefer to hypnotize themselves,<br /> 
oh shameful waste, as she&#8217;s been graced<br /> 
with a face and that&#8217;s my pendulum&#8217;s place</p> 
</blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p>closing elegant moves to sell her door,<br /> 
we loved the sound of it and sold rotary figures clothed in her odor<br /> 
you say that&#8217;s not sales, just crosswords,<br /> 
but before this gets heated, let me add: i&#8217;m not qualified<br /> 
to pick the correct side of any argument.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p>all i know is, above all, the sky.<br /> 
you&#8217;re hereby relieved, go brush your ponies.</p> 
</blockquote>
